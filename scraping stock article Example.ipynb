It is important to note that the dip in IQ stock is not all from intrinsic problems.\\nAll Chinese stocks have been under severe pressure. In fact, IQ stock has done better than the group. The\\xa0 iShares China Large-Cap ETF \\xa0(NYSEARCA: FXI ) is down 17% year-to-date; Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) are down over 25%.\\nIQIYI stock is a relatively new entrant to the stock market. It came out of the gate earlier this year like a rocket rallying to $46 per share. But the 180% rally came crashing back down to earth after its June highs. Now it is struggling to recover $16 per share.\\xa0So for those who missed the IPO opportunity, this is their chance to start over again.\\nIQ is the so-called \" Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) of China.\" So in theory, the tariff wars should not impact its P&L. Yet, in 2018, investors sold it down with all stocks that had anything to do with China. The fears are that the country leaders won\\'t come to terms in time, and the U.S. will impose more tariffs.\\nOn the way up, IQ was a hyper momentum stock. Meaning it never left clear entry points into it. Conversely, on the way down it looks like it\\'s falling into a giant bottomless chasm.\\xa0The opportunity to accumulate shares while Chinese stocks are still out of favor on Wall Street is here. I consider this is a second chance at grabbing its IPO.\\nBut this is not a bloated stock from the traditional sense, so it will eventually find a bottom. In the long run, it makes sense that if the stock markets are higher, then IQIYI stock is also higher. So even though $15 may not be the absolute bottom for it, starting long into a position, or adding to one makes sense.\\nThe macroeconomic conditions still favor the bullish thesis for IQ. It is only because of geopolitical headlines that the buyers have shied away from buying dips in the stock. But eventually this too shall pass. There will be buyers as value opportunities present themselves.\\nCase in point, on Wednesday, the S&P 500 rallied 5% proving that there is pent up demand to buy once the fears abate. Coming into Wednesday, there was a lot of upside pressure in options open interest and the giant burst upwards relieved a lot of it. This is to say that there could be another leg lower, but it should be one that long-term buyers would dare to buy.\\nThese are uncertain times as we still have several headlines risks. In addition to the tariff wars, investors fear the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated his intent on raising rates regardless of what the data says. Doing that would be reckless, so I have to believe that he is bluffing. He is in a battle of words with President Trump, so what he says may not be what he will eventually do.\\n\\nThe Fed will not break the economy on purpose. It has spent too much effort bringing the economy off its knees from the 2008 financial disaster. After all is said and done, the Fed will do the right thing. So, in essence, we have three egos in charge of the headline risk and I have to respect that. Therefore, I only take partial entries into position in order to leave room to add more into IQ in case we do go lower.\\nTechnically, there\\'s not much to discern from the chart of IQ stock except that it has hit support. I say this because we don\\'t have any levels lower than what we just set, so from here it will be market dependent.\\nIQIYI will report earnings sometime in January and this could change. Onus is on management to prove that the rally they enjoyed out of there IPO box was indeed justified. So from here, IQIYI stock will need the overall sentiment on Wall Street to improve, and in about a month, it will also need its management team to deliver a solid earnings report in the first quarter of 2019.\\nAnalysts agree that is is a \"Buy\" and it is now trading well below their lowest price range. Nevertheless, I still consider this a speculative trade inside a conservative investment portfolio, so trade size is important.\\nClick\\xa0 here \\xa0and enjoy a free video and more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.\\xa0Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of\\xa0 SellSpreads.com .

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\n Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) \\xa0has another record-breaking hit on its   hands. The leading premium video streaming service tweeted on   Friday that more than 45 million of its accounts had streamed   Bird Box    -- the creepy dystopian horror flick starring Sandra Bullock --   in its first seven days of availability.\\nNo movie has been as successful as   Bird Box    has been for Netflix in its first week of platform exclusivity.   But a new record isn't a surprise, as the service's audience   grows with every passing quarter. Total Netflix memberships have   grown from 109.3 million to 135.1 million over the past year. For   Bird Box    \\xa0to reach a third of its accounts in a week is a pretty big   deal, but records will keep falling with future releases as   Netflix's popularity continues to grow.\\n  \\nImage source: Netflix.\\nTook off my blindfold this morning to discover that 45,037,125   Netflix accounts have already watched Bird Box - best first 7   days ever for a Netflix film!      pic.twitter.com/uorU3cSzHR \\n \\nThere are a few ways to approach the flick's huge reach over   the past week, and they all bode well for Netflix. Let's start   with the   sheer volume of eyeballs    on this thing. Many are comparing the film to this year's sleeper   apocalyptic hit   A Quiet Place    , a film that rang up $188 million in domestic ticket sales and   $340.7 million worldwide. At a nationwide average price of $9.14   per ticket, we're talking about a little more than 20 million   stateside viewers of that film through its entire run. The   worldwide box office receipts bring it closer to Netflix's haul,   but again,   Bird Box    did this in a single week.\\nMore importantly, Netflix is only talking about the 45   million-plus accounts that streamed the title. Odds are a lot of   those people weren't watching it alone. It's probably a   conservative estimate to say that over 100 million people have   already seen the digital release. And there's no way 100 million   people would've seen   Bird Box    in its first week if it had been a theatrical release.\\nThe appeal of a Netflix release is the value proposition. Most   folks who streamed it wouldn't have shelled out nearly as much as   they pay for an entire month of Netflix to catch it once at the   corner multiplex. However, if you're a movie maker, isn't   reaching the largest audience possible the goal? Netflix is   cutting big checks for content, but beyond being good money, it's   just smart to work with Netflix if you want to expand the   audience and marketing potential of a theatrical release.\\nNetflix is on a roll. It's coming off yet another   blowout quarter    , and it continues to pad its lead over the rest of the premium   streaming options. The competition isn't exactly asleep at the   wheel, and   new rivals are coming    in the year ahead. However, hearing that a new release can hit   more than 45 million homes in a single week will make it that   much harder for smaller services to compete. Netflix can spend   more than $8 billion a year on content because it has the largest   premium audience, and if money alone isn't a draw, Netflix can   offer the world's largest group of potential viewers.\\nNetflix is winning now, and it will continue to win in   2019.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn't one of     them!

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Immediate Release\\n\\n\\nChicago, IL - December 31, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX , AT&T T , Disney DIS , Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA .\\n\\n\\nHere are highlights from Friday\\'s Analyst Blog:\\n\\n\\n4 Factors to Consider Before investing in Netflix for 2019\\n\\n\\nNetflix has been the best-performing FAANG stock in 2018, thanks to its impressive content portfolio that is well-supported by a whopping budget. The company is expected to have 1000 originals - movies and television shows - on its streaming platform by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, Netflix\\'s focus on investing in original as well as regional content has helped it win accolades and awards this year. The company was recently named as the \"Entertainer of the Year\" by Associated Press (AP). At Emmys, it tied up with AT&T\\'s HBO, winning 23 awards in different categories.\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Stranger Things soundtrack recently won a Grammy Award nomination in the \"Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media\" category. Moreover, the company won eight nominations at the Golden Globe, most among the streaming providers.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, its recently released Roma has been announced the best movie of the year by the New York Film Critics Circle and won the Golden Lion Award. Roma \\'s Alfonso Cuaron also won the best director and best cinematography awards for the year.\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s strong content portfolio is helping it win subscribers rapidly. The company added almost 7 million subscribers in the last reported quarter (third-quarter) and expects to add another 9.4 million in fourth-quarter 2018. Paid member addition is expected to increase 15% to 7.6 million.\\n\\n\\nThe aforesaid factors have been major growth drivers for Netflix shares that have returned 33.1% year to date, against 7.6% decline of the S&P 500 Composite.\\n\\n\\nHere we discuss four factors that should be taken into account while considering investment in Netflix for 2019.\\n\\n\\nExpanding Original Content & Movie Slate\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Roma leads the Oscar nomination list for Best Foreign Language Film. Notably, the company won first feature-film Oscar for documentary Icarus in 2018. The success of Roma surely validates the company\\'s evolution as a major movie studio, which is helping it attract major Hollywood talents.\\n\\n\\nThe company is currently working or set to work with a number of renowned Hollywood directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Dee Rees, Guillermo del Toro, Noah Baumbach and Michael Bay. Actors involved with the streaming platform include Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck, Eddie Murphy, Sandra Bullock and Dwayne \"Rock\" Johnson, among others.\\n\\n\\nReportedly, Netflix is planning to produce 90 movies a year, out of which 55 will be original films, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $200 million.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, Hollywood \\'A\\' listers like Idris Elba ( Turn Up Charlie ), Ellen Page ( The Umbrella Academy ), Renee Zellweger ( What/If ), Uma Thurman ( Chambers ), and Christina Applegate ( Dead To Me ) are set to appear on Netflix in 2019.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, partnerships with prolific creators like Ryan Murphy, Kenya Barris, Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan are noteworthy. Netflix has also signed multi-year production deal with Barack and Michelle Obama. These are providing impetus to the company\\'s content expansion strategy.\\n\\n\\nRegional Content to Boost International Footprint\\n\\n\\nAlthough China remains elusive to Netflix, the company is expected to benefit from increasing presence in international markets. The company has big plans for India, with the country\\'s upcoming slate for 2019 including 12 local language original series and 20 local language films.\\n\\n\\nNetflix has plans to order original shows from Africa in 2019. The streaming giant has already forayed into Nigeria, the world\\'s second-biggest movie industry by volume, after purchasing worldwide rights to Lionheart .\\n\\n\\nNetflix is also working on projects across Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East.\\n\\n\\nCompetition Intensifying in the Streaming Space\\n\\n\\nNotably, 2019 is expected to see intensifying competition in the streaming market. Not only Disney and Apple but also Comcast\\'s NBC Universal and AT&T\\'s WarnerMedia are expected to enter this rapidly growing field next year.\\n\\n\\nBudgets are also expected to increase manifold. AT&T is expected to invest more on HBO and WarnerMedia. Both Amazon Prime Video and Hulu are anticipated to increase their budget to fight upcoming competition.\\n\\n\\nNetflix is expected to reach $13 billion in gross content spending in 2018 (more than $8 billion on new content), which is likely to increase in 2019. On the other hand, Apple is estimated to spend $1 billion in 2018, which is expected to hit $4.2 billion by 2022.\\n\\n\\nNotably, the combined expenditure from Disney and Comcast, post their respective acquisition of 21st Century Fox and Sky, is expected to reach $43 billion by the end of 2018, per Ampere report. The budget is likely to increase in 2019.\\n\\n\\nHigh Debt Level a Concern, Cash Burn to Continue\\n\\n\\nNetflix is a highly leveraged company. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $8.34 billion. Debt-equity ratio was 166.4%, much higher than the S&P 500 Composite\\'s 82.2%. Notably, in October, the company raised roughly $2 billion in financing through debt securities.\\n\\n\\nFurther, streaming content obligations were $18.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, this Zacks Rank #3 stock continues to burn cash. In the third quarter, free cash outflow was $859 million compared with $465 million in the year-ago quarter. For 2018, the company continues to expect free cash outflow of $3-$4 billion.\\n\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today\\'s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\\n\\n\\nWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.\\n\\n\\nWith battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not the one you think.\\n\\n\\nSee This Ticker Free >>\\n\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.zacks.com\\n\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

The recovery saw the Dow ending the day up more than 250 points. All three major indexes ended in positive territory. Thursday's gains come a day after all three major indexes posted their biggest percentage increases in almost a decade.\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 1.1% to close at 23,138.82. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to close at 2,488.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 6,579.49, increasing 0.4%.

On Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.\\n How did the Benchmarks Perform? \\nThe Dow ended the day up 260.37 points, after losing as much as 611 points at its session low. The Dow's rebound from a 2.67% at its session low to end in positive territory is also its biggest intra-day swing on percentage basis since Oct 4, 2011, when the index had bounced back from a fall of 2.75% at its session low.\\nThe S&P 500 gained 21.13 points after erasing a decline of 2.8% at its session low. Thursday's rebound was also the biggest intra-day swing for the S&P 500 since 25, 2010. Materials and industrials were the biggest gainers.

In fact, this week has been volatile. Markets closed sharply lower on Monday, recording their sharpest losses in history on the eve of Christmas in a holiday-shortened session.However, stocks staged a major comeback on the day after Christmas, with all three major indexes posting their biggest percentage gains in nearly a decade.\\nOn Thursday, stocks initially failed to hold on to the gains made in the previous session amid renewed tensions between the United States and China on reports that President Donald Trump is considering to issue an executive order in the New Year that would ban U.S. companies to use telecommunications equipment made by Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei.\\nHowever, the initial losses were finally erased in the last hour of trading. That said, all three major indexes are still down more than 9% on a month-to-date basis, with the S&P 500 on track for its biggest ever annual percentage decline since 2008. \\xa0\\xa0\\n Initial Claims, Consumer Confidence Fall\\xa0 \\nThe Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell by 1,000 to 216,000 in the week ended Dec 22. On the other hand, the Conference Board said that consumer confidence fell to 128.1 this month from a revised 136.4 in November.\\n Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars? \\nHere's another stock idea to consider.

Revenue (TTM)    |      Netflix, Inc. Quote   Can Award Winning Content Help Netflix Please Marvel   Fans?      Although Marvel fans will be disappointed with Netflix's decision   to remove these shows, we believe the company's award winning   content   portfolio    may keep user interest alive.        The company's recently released movie,   Roma    , won the best movie of the year by the New York Film Critics   Circle and won the Golden Lion Award. Further, it is the top pick   for the Oscar nomination list for Best Foreign Language Film.        Moreover, Netflix is engaging its users by promoting merchandise   related to its popular titles. The company promotes merchandise   across categories like books, comics, gaming toys, collectibles,   soundtrack and apparel.        Further, Netflix's deal with Telltale Games to produce a video   game related to one of its highly popular original series,   Stranger Things    for consoles and PCs depicts the number of ways in which the   company can boost user engagement.        These initiatives not only allow Netflix to monetize on its   original content investments but also help the company remain a   dominant player in the streaming market despite the entry of   players like Apple   AAPL    , Sinclair Broadcasting   SBGI    and others.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nIt's been a roller coaster of a market lately. But after a fear-inspiring price plunge and potential corrective bottom; the price for admission in Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS ) stock looks like a good value - both on and off the DIS stock price chart. Let me explain.\\nIn some ways it's almost been like watching paint dry in 2018 for DIS stock with shares up less than 1% on the price chart. Still, compared to the Dow Industrial , which is off more than 5%, that might not seem like such a bad thing, right? Regardless, if you've been patiently holding Disney or are just now eyeing the House of Mouse, the good news is shares have the earmarks of a breakout year in 2019.\\nBottom and top line, while DIS stock hasn't done much, the same can't be said off the price chart. In a record-breaking year for Hollywood, Disney franchises such as Avengers, Black Panther and Incredibles continued to make box-office gold in 2018. And Disney's theme parks are still the most popular on the planet as well. But that's not all.\\nDIS stock's drawn-out and anxiously-awaited acquisition of 20th Century Fox and its valuable media assets is set to complete in early 2019. And with Disney's streaming service Disney Plus also coming online later next year to compete against the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ); 2019 is shaping up to be a strong one for the entertainment giant.\\nSure and as InvestorPlace's Vince Martin recently wrote, Disney still has an ESPN problem. But as we can also appreciate, overall business at the House of Mouse is far from dead. And given that shares have been on ice or sitting Frozen the last three-plus years; the business of fun for DIS stock bulls looks very good for 2019.\\n\\r\\n Click to Enlarge\\nAs Vince Martin noted, there's a lot that 'could' go wrong at Disney due to its one-time sacred cash cow ESPN. Likewise, there's a lot of possible hazards on the price chart of DIS stock. Shares did fail earlier this year to break out from its massive triangle base shown on the provided weekly chart. I suppose that's one example already in the books.\\nOverall though, Disney is making the right moves off for a breakout year in 2019. The combination of skepticism regarding DIS stock, a lengthy technical consolidation worthy of relative strength leadership and now, a solid-looking hold of pattern support should offer bullish investors a more profitable sequel of sorts with a second breakout to fresh highs and a continued rally.\\nFor Disney bulls agreeable with what's been presented, I'd propose waiting for DIS stock to reclaim $109 before going long. With Friday's high of $108.31 this price level serves a couple purposes.\\nFirst, the weekly candlestick which held Disney's pattern angular support line and the 200-week simple moving average will receive confirmation a low is in place. Secondly, by entering DIS stock as it clears $109 investors are buying shares as they move above the angular pattern resistance line of the triangle.\\nLastly, by entering at $109 the price for admission looks all the more attractive given this investor can use the low of the prior weekly candlestick and keep potential losses contained to a manageable 8% of DIS stock risk if a 'could' becomes a reality.\\nDisclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nFor the most part,   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) is known for its wide selection of streaming TV   series -- from licensed content to its own Netflix Originals. But   the company has been making a big push into self-produced   feature-length films recently. This strategy is getting put to   the test more than ever as the company rolls out more feature   films.\\nFortunately, one of Netflix\\'s just-released films highlights   promising potential for the company\\'s foray into feature films.   Bird Box    , starring Sandra Bullock, garnered views from nearly a third of   the company\\'s global subscriber base, Netflix said in a tweet on   Friday.\\n  \\nImage source: Netflix.\\nOver 45 million Netflix accounts had watched   Bird Box    during the first seven days of the thriller\\'s availability on the   company\\'s streaming platform.\\xa0With 137   million\\xa0streaming memberships as of the end of the company\\'s   third quarter, this means nearly a third of the company\\'s   accounts had already streamed the movie. Of course, the movie\\'s   reach extends beyond these 45 million accounts since many of   these streams were likely viewed by more than one user.\\nManagement has been particularly optimistic about original   films ever since the company witnessed the success of   Bright    , an action film released late last year.\\xa0Representing the   company\\'s largest investment in an original film at the time,   Bright    was an important test for the streaming giant. Fortunately, the   film was \"a major success,\" management said in the company\\'s   shareholder letter for its fourth quarter of 2017.\\nThe movie \"drove a notable lift in [member] acquisition,\"   management noted. The success meant Netflix is planning a sequel   for the film and further investment in feature films, management   said at the time.\\nNetflix has since launched a range of original films,   including romantic comedies   Set It Up, The Kissing Booth    , and more. Indeed, Netflix said this summer that it planned to   launch 86 original films in 2018 -- more than the top four   traditional studios combined.\\nNetflix\\'s early success in self-produced films has helped the   company land movie deals for upcoming releases by top directors   Michael Bay, Martin Scorsese, Alfonso Cuaron, Susanne Bier, Paul   Greengrass, and Chris Columbus.\\nUnsurprisingly, Netflix wants to keep ramping up its   investments in feature films. This is reflected by management\\'s   guidance for a sequential decline in its operating margin in the   second half of 2018. A higher mix of original films during the   second half of the year is expected to weigh on profitability   since film amortization is front-loaded due to accelerated   viewing trends compared to TV series.\\nNetflix\\'s growing appetite for original TV series and, now,   self-produced films is costly. Self-produced content requires   significant upfront investments, pressuring cash   flow.\\xa0Management expects free cash flow for 2018 to be   around negative $3 billion.\\nOver the long haul, Netflix believes these investments will   pay off in helping sustain revenue and operating profit growth.   But investors will want to keep an eye out for more stories like   the success of   Bird Box    to help support the case for continued investments in original   films.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn\\'t one of     them!

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nAfter the worst Christmas Eve trading session ever , U.S. equities are doing their best to put on their Santa caps and get a rally going. We're seeing a significant bounce in the indices and investors are wondering how long this bounce can last. Instead of the indices though, let's take a special look at FAANG for our top stock trades for tomorrow.\\n\\nDespite a bevy of negative news, shares of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) were doing relatively well. At least, compared to the rest of the market. In fact, the stock is outperforming the rest of its FAANG peers so far this month and is the second-best performer this quarter.\\nBet you wouldn't have guessed that, but now what?\\nShares are currently below the 200-week moving average and remain trapped in a tough downtrend. First thing's first, FB need to break the downtrend and hopefully get back over the 200-week moving average.\\nIf it does, it may be able to work up the strength to test the $150 level, the spring lows during the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Below this week's lows and FB's price action can get ugly.\\n\\n\\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has had a rough go of it, but our previous $1,350 target from earlier this month is showing hopes of holding. The stock did overshoot that level by a bit, but is bouncing nicely on Wednesday, up almost $100 per share.\\nWe could see Amazon add another $100 to $200 per share depending on how strong of a bounce we can get here. But keep in mind, while a bounce may feel nice, there are countless levels of resistance overhead. Don't hesitate to take profits if we near some of these marks, particularly over $1,550.\\n\\n\\nAt its lows, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was down more than $85 per share from its high at the beginning of the fourth quarter. That's a more than 36% beating in one of the world's most successful companies. You better believe Apple and Warren Buffett are in there buying with both hands.\\nShould you? Honestly, I would have loved for a test of $140 and the 200-week moving average, but if we're going to rally, sub-$150 isn't bad either. The stock's cheap, growth is good and the balance sheet is made of kevlar .\\nDown 11 of 12 weeks entering this week and Apple is oversold, plain and simple. I'm a buyer.\\n\\n\\nWe recently looked at a short entry in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) and said a break of $250 was bad news. That has panned out pretty well, with NFLX all but filling the gap from January. Not many bulls would have predicted that in June.\\nBut man, I really wish it would have officially filled the gap just under $230. I would feel better about the name going forward if it did.\\nAlas, it didn't and now we'll have to see what kind of bounce we get. So far, shares are still trapped in a relentless downtrend. We'll need to see that give way for any sustainable upside to occur. Just getting there though is a $20 to $30 per share rally. Not bad.\\n\\n\\nLast but not least, the company formerly known as Google and now known as Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) rounds out the FAANG group. As we've pointed out 1,000 times before here on InvestorPlace, the $1,000 mark on GOOGL remains critical.\\nBreaking below this level for any sustainable amount of time spells trouble and could easily send Alphabet down another 5% to 10%. So far though, it's holding up. That's likely as investors find GOOGL to be a value play and relish its rock-solid balance sheet .\\nThe stock broke down below uptrend support (blue line) in October and failed on a retest back in November. Since then, it's been caught in a tough downtrend. If $1,000 can hold it up, perhaps GOOGL stock can break over downtrend resistance and start to chip away at some of its bearish momentum.\\xa0If it can't, maybe we'll get a longer shot at GOOGL in the triple digits.\\nWhen the market eventually bottoms, Alphabet will be a go-to name, whatever price that may be at.\\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nCable giant   Comcast    (NASDAQ: CMCSA) is on a roll these days. The company hasn\\'t   missed an earnings target since the end of 2015. Revenue and   EBITDA profits    have been trending steadily upward for about a decade. Analysts   love the stock, too -- 19 out of 24 Wall Street firms with a   published opinion on Comcast rate it as some sort of buy right   now and the last five would just hold this stock.\\nThat\\'s great, but   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) is still a much better investment in the media   sector. Let me show you why.\\n  \\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nComcast\\'s bread and butter business is getting stale. People   just don\\'t subscribe to big-ticket cable TV packages like they   used to, and the telephone component of Comcast\\'s \"triple-play\"   packages is losing value to cellphones day by day. The company is   adding high-speed internet subscribers faster than it\\'s losing TV   customers, so it\\'s not an entirely lost cause.\\nStill, internet service revenue that accounts for just 20% of   Comcast\\'s quarterly revenue is facing competitive pressures of   its own. Cable modems are not the only game in town for   high-speed internet access anymore, and telecoms will start   muscling in on that market over the next few years with fixed and   mobile wireless plans based on the new 5G standard. Comcast is   working around these issues by pursuing international growth   through   a $39 billion buyout of European pay-TV giant   Sky     .\\nOn top of all that, the NBCUniversal content division ebbs and   flows with each year\\'s relative hits and misses -- like any other   traditional Hollywood studio. At the moment, that arm of   Comcast\\'s operations is helped by strongly profitable theme park   operations, based on the Harry Potter sections of Universal   Studios parks around the world.\\nSo Comcast investors have to embrace a very cash-intense   international growth strategy to make up for dim domestic   prospects, and you never really know how the TV and movie studio   will perform next year. Personally, I\\'d rather not invest in a   business model as hollow as Comcast\\'s.\\nBoth Comcast\\'s NBCUniversal studio and Netflix produce a lot   of original content. The ways these companies monetize their   content couldn\\'t be further apart.\\nNetflix isn\\'t aiming for blockbuster hits that could bring a   windfall at the box office and maybe spawn a franchise of sequels   and spinoff titles. Instead, it\\'s all about delivering a   consistently high level of quality across many genres and niches   in order to pull in curious potential customers for a free trial   and then inspiring them to pay full price for several years of   paid subscriptions. Without an effective ecosystem of great   content for pretty much every taste, any single megahit would   just boost the number of unpaid one-month trials for a short   while.\\nYou might compare this approach to Comcast\\'s TV networks,   ranging from Telemundo and NBC to Oxygen and Syfy. Like Netflix,   these networks depend on a steady stream of subscription fees   where any particular blockbuster or flop doesn\\'t make or break   the business model as a whole. However, these networks are   typically bundled up in broad cable service packages -- and   we\\'ve already talked about what\\'s happening to   those    . Netflix stands alone, attracting or losing customers on its own   merits. Judging by the company\\'s industry-leading 112 Emmy   nominations and 23 wins in 2018,   Netflix is doing something right    . That\\'s why the company was able to add 28 million paying   subscribers over the last year while also raising prices.\\nThere you have it: Netflix is growing rapidly thanks to a   conscious investment in high-quality content while Comcast   attempts to nurse its outdated business model back to health.   There\\'s no question in my mind: Netflix is the better company and   stock by far.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like even better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Netflix wasn\\'t one of     them!

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nIn the grueling bear move during the fourth quarter, utility stocks have held up relatively well.\\xa0 After all, they generally provide for much more stability in their businesses, as well as higher levels of dividend payouts.\\nYet, AT&T (NYSE: T ) stock has not benefited from this. During the past three months, the shares are off 14%. In fact, the year-to-date return is -22%.\\nEven worse, T stock has lagged its main rival, Verizon (NYSE: VZ ), which has returned 9% for 2018.\\nSo, what's going on here? Is AT&T stock at a good buy point right now?\\nWell, first of all, AT&T is in the midst of a major transformation - moving away from its core utility business. Of course, this has been the result of the $81 billion acquisition of Time Warner (the deal represents about 37% of the value of AT&T stock).\\nAnd, yes, getting the deal done has definitely been a challenge.\\xa0\\xa0The federal government waged a bruising antitrust case against the transaction. And even when this was defeated and the deal closed, the Justice Department appealed the decision! Although, it looks like the agency will again lose.\\nBut I think the fight for Time Warner was worth it - and should be a positive for the AT&T stock price. Let's face it, the mobile business is fairly mature in the US. So, with Time Warner's media assets, there is the potential to generate more growth in the coming years.\\nKeep in mind that the entertainment assets are standout. They include marquee properties like the WB movie studios, HBO and Turner. Consider that the annual media revenues are roughly $31 billion.\\nAT&T's massive mobile network should also provide nice distribution synergies. For example, the company has over 170 million D2C (direct-to-consumer) relationships. In the next few years, there should also be benefits from the move to 5G, which will mean richer media experiences on smartphones.\\nPerhaps the most important catalyst for growth for AT&T stock is streaming. As seen with the success of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), the business can be quite lucrative. There are ongoing recurring revenues as well as improving analytics on user behaviors, which can help make the service more personalized.\\xa0 Because of this, other mega-entertainment operators, like Disney (NYSE: DIS ), are ramping their streaming efforts.\\nAs for AT&T, the company plans\\xa0to launch its service in the fourth quarter of 2019 and it will have three tiers: movies, original programming (such as with HBO) and the Warner and film library. AT&T has also named Kevin Reilly as the chief of this business. Prior to this, he led the turnaround of TNT and TBS. Oh, and when he was at NBC, he was critical in the development of breakout shows like The Office .\\nFor now, the details of the streaming service are still sketchy. But AT&T does have the resources, assets and talent to put together a solid platform.\\nAT&T definitely has its issues. Just look at the DirecTV business, which continues to shed subscribers because of the trend of cord-cutting.\\nHowever, it seems like much of the bad news is already baked into AT&T stock. Note that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is a dirt-cheap 8.\\nWhat's more, the dividend yield is a juicy 7% - and the company has enough cash flows to cover it. For next year, the company projects that free cash flows will come to $26 billion and the dividend payouts will be about $15.6 billion. In other words, there is a good margin of safety.\\nSo, investors will get a nice yield while they wait for initiatives like the streaming service to get traction.\\nTom Taulli is the author of\\xa0 High-Profit IPO Strategies ,\\xa0 All About Commodities \\xa0and\\xa0 All About Short Selling .\\xa0Follow him on Twitter at\\xa0 @ttaulli .\\xa0As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post AT&T Dividend Is Too Good to Pass Up? appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nEquity markets have been in turmoil for months. The mighty bulls have stumbled since October and they have not been able to find footing. For a while, experts in the media have called for retesting the February lows. They got their wish, but that opened a trap door below it so now there is rampant fear. As a result, this is the worst December on record and perhaps the first red year since the rally started off the 2008 debacle. Despite the carnage, there still are some stocks in the green and Nike (NYSE: NKE ) stock is one of them. Year-to-date, NKE stock is still up 7%. Compare that to the S&P 500 down 12% for the same period.\\nEven more impressive is that Nike stock did this while the retail sector has been especially devastated in this correction.\\nThe SPDR S&P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA: XRT ) is down 17%. There are stronger stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Lululemon (NASDAQ: LULU ) up 11% and 42%, respectively, but Nike stock is holding its own.\\nNKE reported earnings last week and it delivered a gem. NKE stock rallied on the headline in spite of very weak markets. Management beat expectations on all metrics and told a good story going forward. Nike grew its digital sales 40%, so it is definitely on board with the all-important e-tail trend.\\nI was lucky to have profited from a short-term directional upside bet on the earnings reaction. So I come into today with profits in pocket. Regardless, the macroeconomic conditions are still healthy, so this is the time to start or add to a long-term position in NKE stock.\\nThis is not the same as calling the bottom in the stock. In fact, the S&P charts suggest a bounce off these oversold conditions but another dip to follow to set even lower lows in the next few weeks. So going long now means that I am ready to live through another test in January.\\nFundamentally, Nike stock is a proven winner. The company rarely commits faux pas that spook Wall Street. It was tested recently with the NFL \"kneel-gate\", when the company signed Colin Kaepernick as a spokesperson, but it survived the public opinion unscathed.\\nNKE dominates on the global stage and this is likely to persist for decades. It continues to fend off challengers like\\xa0 Adidas\\xa0 (OTCMKTS: ADDYY ) and\\xa0 Under Armour \\xa0(NYSE: UAA ). This is the Goliath that won\\'t be easy to beat.\\nCurrently, the retail sector is under sever pressure mainly from what Amazon started a decade ago. But Nike has its own line of products, so it controls its own destiny. This is not like a brick-and-mortar department store that sells third-party products for low margins.\\n\\nNKE\\'s advantage is much like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has in streaming. Consumers want its products, so demand remains strong. Another example of Nike\\'s advantage is LuluLemon (NASDAQ: LULU ); it too markets its own brands and its stock is up 42%.\\nNKE stock sells at a price-to-earning ratio of 26, which is not cheap. But it is not bloated either, so investors will allow for a little froth if they see performance. The Nike earnings report is proof that they are. This gives management more leeway for a P/E premium.\\nWall Street experts are split between \"Buy\" and \"Hold\", but they all see more upside in the Nike stock price. And NKE is trading 25% below their average price target range.\\nTechnically, Nike stock has fallen into 12-month support. The $65-per-share zone has been pivotal before, so it will provide support on the way down. This is a good base for bulls to defend the stock, though it will need help from the general markets.\\nThis also has been a contention level dating back to November 2015, so it is even more significant for the long term. I am confident that in the long run, if stocks in general are higher, NKE stock will also be higher.\\nSince these are still treacherous markets, it is best to not enter a full position all at once; entering in tranches allows room to adjust for short-term pitfalls.\\nClick\\xa0 here \\xa0for more of my market thesis and get an ongoing free copy of my weekly newsletters.\\xa0Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of\\xa0 SellSpreads.com .

Consequently, he said no blocks of the company\\'s shares were placed with large institutional shareholders.\\n\"A generous portion of IPO shares are typically allocated to tier-one, blue-chip funds intending to be long term holders and accumulators of the stock,\" Sanderson wrote. \"We think that with fewer of these anchor investors, we should expect greater volatility in the stock (especially in downturns).\"\\nFor example, Netflix  (NFLX) has twice as many large holders with stakes of 0.4% or larger in its stock versus Spotify, according to the analyst.

Moreover, partnership with Comcast to develop back-end software to support services for Xfinity mobile offering will significantly help Charter in saving costs.   Conclusion    T-Mobile is benefiting from improvement in mobile plans, stellar network performance, deployment of LTE-U technology and offering of attractive unlimited data. This is supported by improving scale, healthy free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and spectrum assets that provide credit support.    The company is also making progress on its pending Sprint Corporation merger  as it recently secured approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Additionally, Team Telecom, which comprises the U.S. Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense, gave its green signal to the proposed deal.    Although these are positives for T-Mobile, the company is likely to find it difficult to dethrone Comcast and Charter, at least in the near term, due to the aforesaid factors.

That will be no comfort for\\xa0 Facebook \\xa0(NASDAQ: FB ). In addition to the broader market troubles, the social-media giant must also contend with massive PR scandals. Critics have argued that these self-inflicted wounds have sharply impacted FB stock.\\nIt\\'s tough to deny the correlation. Since the start of the year, Facebook stock has dropped 30%. Against its all-time closing high, shares are down a whopping 43%. But the worst part is that the bulls have failed to overcome the ugly narrative.\\nIn early spring of this year,\\xa0 The New York Times \\xa0and\\xa0 The Guardian \\xa0broke the\\xa0 Cambridge Analytica scandal . Long story short, FB facilitated a conservative research firm to data mine some of its users. The issue was that this occurred without the users\\' knowledge.\\nThe resultant anger sparked the #DeleteFacebook movement. It even sparked\\xa0 websites \\xa0detailing how to accomplish exactly that.\\nRecently, the NYT broke another embarrassing expose. The news agency\\'s investigation discovered that Facebook allowed companies to \" read, write and delete \\xa0users\\' private messages.\" These companies include\\xa0 Netflix \\xa0(NASDAQ: NFLX ) and\\xa0 Spotify \\xa0(NYSE: SPOT ) - who have an obvious interest in user behaviors.\\nIf that wasn\\'t ugly enough for FB stock, the company also allowed\\xa0 Microsoft \\'s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Bing search engine to view a user\\'s friends without consent. Apparently, Facebook allowed similar privacy breaches for\\xa0 Amazon \\xa0(NASDAQ: AMZN ).\\nSince the latest scandal broke, Facebook stock has suffered severe beatdowns. The incident also gave the entire social-media complex a black eye.\\nNevertheless, this too shall pass - at least from an investment perspective - for three critical reasons:\\nIf you\\'re eyeing FB stock, but worry that this latest controversy will derail your investment, don\\'t. While I obviously can\\'t guarantee a smooth ride, I can almost certainly tell you that worry about the scandal is overblown.\\nA little over a year ago, I covered the\\xa0 Equifax \\xa0(NYSE: EFX ) scandal. If you don\\'t remember, Equifax failed its security protocol. As a result,\\xa0 143 million people had their personal information compromised .\\nWe\\'re not talking about inconsequential information, like where you eat your ice cream. Instead, cybercriminals stole vital stats, like social security numbers and birth dates. Such a massive breach will hurt Americans for decades, perhaps even generationally.\\nI don\\'t condone violence or any acts of intimidation. However, if people stormed Equifax\\'s headquarters with their pitchforks, I wouldn\\'t feel any sympathy. This was a horrific, unforgivable oversight.\\nBut what happened to its share price? After suffering a complete meltdown, EFX worked its way back towards its former glory days. True, shares have again melted down, but this time due to the broader market weakness.\\nCould Facebook stock go against the grain and crumble? It\\'s possible, but I highly doubt it.\\nOn paper, the odds appear stacked against FB stock. You now have multiple allegations harping on the same privacy theme. Reading between the lines, Facebook has an abusive culture that turns a blind eye on unethical corporate-partnership profiteering.\\nBut what they also may have is a viable defense. According to\\xa0 USA Today , \"the social network said the partnerships didn\\'t give \\'companies access to information\\xa0 without people\\'s permission .\\'\" The news organization further states that \"Many users zip through user agreements and have said they don\\'t recall giving the companies the permission to read direct messages.\"\\nI sympathize with the outraged. Nobody has the time to read through the litany of verbiage that keep corporate attorneys happy and gainfully employed. Ultimately, though, that\\'s no excuse for not reading the fine print. Yes, Facebook is gaming the system, but that in itself isn\\'t illegal.\\nBut even if the company is guilty as charged, I\\'m not sure if Facebook stock will actually suffer. You\\'ve heard of big banks being too big to fail. In this case, FB is too big to prosecute.\\nAs in similar cases, FB may end up paying a fine. But beyond that, I don\\'t think any institution will take the company to task. If you prosecute Facebook, you open the door to convoluted internet laws.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s face it: internet operators are violating privacy regulations all the time. Taking down FB requires taking down its partners who engage in the same crime.\\nIn other words, don\\'t hold your breath.\\nInvestors should treat FB stock as a long-term buy because the social-media firm has integrated itself into nearly every corner of society. The platform is too useful and dominant to simply walk away from without incurring consequences.\\nFor one thing, Facebook meets the true definition of a digital social network. With now 2.2 billion daily active users (across all platforms), the company features an unrivaled platform with broad demographic representation.\\nYou can\\'t say that about the competition.\\xa0 Snap \\xa0(NYSE: SNAP ) clearly caters to younger audiences, and hasn\\'t generated traction with the older crowd.\\xa0 Twitter \\xa0(NYSE: TWTR ) has a wider user base than Snap, but can\\'t touch Facebook stock on sheer numbers.\\nInterestingly, both companies have taken a dive in December, so neither has advantaged Facebook\\'s PR crisis.\\nMore importantly, Facebook is everywhere. While a vocal few may permanently delete their accounts, that\\'s not going to impact FB stock indefinitely. Any major business these days has a social-media presence. If they do, they have Facebook. It has the numbers, the demographic diversity, and the international exposure that other platforms lack.\\nThis fundamental tailwind will not change for at least several years. So while you may not like Facebook news, remember that FB stock is essentially a separate entity.\\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\\nThe post 3 Reasons Why Facebook\\'s Scandal Can\\'t Touch FB Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\n For Immediate Release \\nChicago, IL - December 27, 2018 - Zacks Equity Research  Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories RDY  as the Bull of the Day, Dillard\\'s Inc DDS  asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Facebook FB  , Netflix NFLX  and Amazon Prime AMZN  .\\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\\n  Bull of the Day   :\\nObviously, the last three months have been brutal for equity investors. Fears about interest rates, the yield curve, trade wars, budget impasses, Brexit, and a host of other concerns have conspired to take almost all stocks lower - in many cases sharply lower.\\nBlue-chips, tech stocks, small caps, and even the usually defensive sectors like heath care and consumer staples have all been sold off broadly.\\xa0 It\\'s hard to find a stock that has even managed to keep its head above water as uneasiness turned to fear and then to panic.\\nNot all  stocks have been battered, though.\\nSince the S&P 500 began the steep decline at the beginning of October that has taken that broad market index down 20%, Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories has actually gained  almost 12%.\\n An Admirable Mission That\\'s Also Profitable \\nFounded by a scientist who recognized that life-saving medications were often too expensive for a large portion of the world\\'s population, Dr. Reddy\\'s goal was to accelerate access to affordable and innovative medicines for as many people as possible. The realization of that goal is a state of the art research facility, employing 800 research scientists as well as extensive support personnel and with several strategic partnerships.\\nRDY\\'s business is fully vertically integrated, offering products and services at all levels of the pharmaceutical supply chain - starting materials, intermediates, active ingredients and finished dosages. Their research encompasses cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammation and bacterial infection, serving the world markets, focusing on India, the US, Europe and Russia.\\nThe company is divided into three units, Pharmaceutical Services and Active ingredients, Global Generics and Proprietary Products.\\nExperience in navigating the various regulatory requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which they operate allows them to be first to market with in-demand and life-saving medications all around the world. In their most recent report to investors, the company lists \"Actively work with the regulatory agencies for accelerating the new product approvals\" as one of its key priorities.\\nEarlier in December, Dr. Reddy\\'s won an important decision in US Federal Circuit court that will allow it to sell its generic version of Suboxone, which is widely prescribed to treat opioid use disorder - a potentially enormous market for RDY as that epidemic continues to grow in the US, and also potentially a life-saver for those who are afflicted.\\n Financials \\nHaving earned $1.01/share in FY 2018, future estimates are on the rise for RDY, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY 2019 currently at $1.42/share - an increase of 40%. Estimates for FY 2020 show even stronger growth, up another 50% to $2.13/share.\\nDr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\\nThough it currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 26X, which is a premium to the Drug Industry average of 19X, RDY\\'s strong balance sheet boasts a debt/equity ratio of just 21%, well below the industry average of 66%, potentially allowing the company to make strategic investments and/or acquisitions that might not be feasible for the competition.\\nEven when the market looks dark for almost all stocks, there are still some shining stars out there, and Dr. Reddy\\'s Laboratories has certainly been one of them.\\n Bear of the Day  :\\nThrough the good and bad periods for the equity markets in 2018, it\\'s been an especially interesting environment for retail stocks. In many cases, it has been feast or famine with some spectacular success stories and some real duds.\\nLululemon and Restoration Hardware are both still showing outstanding 2018 gains even in a weak overall market, and Macy\\'s and Kohl\\'s Stores are certainly holding their own as well, with double-digit YTD returns that look awfully good compared to an 11% loss in the S&P 500.\\nDillard\\'s Inc is unfortunately one of the retailers that has not fared nearly as well and analyst estimates going forward are not optimistic about an imminent turnaround.\\nDillard\\'s finds itself in an uncomfortable position in the retail space, not high-end enough in terms of brand cache to command premium margins, yet with its goods not inexpensive enough to attract the more budget minded customers.\\nThird quarter results at DDS showed an increase of 3% in same store sales - typically a good sign for retailers, yet net earnings were only $0.27/share, well below the $0.50 they posted in net earnings in the same quarter in 2017 and badly missing the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate of $0.56/share.\\nCEO William T. Dillard II explained, \"While we are encouraged by our 3% comparable sales performance, this was a disappointing quarter as markdowns weighed heavily on gross margin, particularly in the first month.\"\\nBasically, increased sales numbers don\\'t matter much if you have to drop prices to achieve them.\\nShares of DDS are nearly 40% off of their 52-week highs reached in June.\\nAfter the big miss, analysts began revising their full year earnings forecasts downward and the consensus has fallen from $6.48/share 60 days ago, to $5.73/share currently.\\nThe consensus estimate for 2020 has fallen by a similar percentage, from $6.03/share to $5.42/share.\\n Additional content: \\n  Citron Turns Bullish: Buy Facebook (FB) in 2019?  \\nShares of Facebook surged over 8% Wednesday after Citron Research and Andrew Left raised their price target for the embattled social media powerhouse, citing Facebook\\'s long-term appeal. So the question is should investors buy  Facebook stock  on the dip as we inch closer to 2019?\\n Citron \\nWell-known short seller Andrew Left of Citron thinks that Facebook stock could reach $160 per share in 2019. The firm pointed out that the company\\'s user data and privacy scandals have had little impact on Facebook\\'s user base and revenues.\\nCitron and Left dove into just how impressive Facebook\\'s user base is, which should help it continue to attract advertisers as non-ad supported platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime attract more and more customers. Plus, the firm presented its case as to why Facebook is hardly \"evil\" compared to many other firms in a report titled \" Citron Research Backing Up the Sleigh on Facebook  .\"\\n\"Books have been written and movies have been made on the Facebook is evil topic, but never before has Facebook been this compelling of an investment opportunity,\" Citron wrote.\\n\"As investors have become overly concerned about the short-term noise of privacy and propaganda, they have forgotten to look at the earnings power and potential of the most advanced advertising tool with global reach in messaging, networking, and the future of shopping. The Facebook platform has advanced a long way and has turned this research firm from a one-time skeptic to a major bull.\"\\nShares of Facebook climbed over 8% to reach $134.18 per share Wednesday after investors reacted positively to Citron calling the social media giant its \"2019 S&P Stock of the Year.\" Despite Wednesday\\'s climb, FB stock would have room for roughly 20% growth before it hit Citron\\'s 2019 target.\\nMedia Contact\\nZacks Investment Research\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n    support@zacks.com \\n    https://www.zacks.com \\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nApple AAPL  saw its stock price surge over 7% the day after Christmas as part of a larger market rally that saw fellow FAANG stocks-Facebook FB  , Amazon AMZN  , Netflix NFLX  , Alphabet GOOGL  -and other giants like Microsoft MSFT  and Nike NKE  all soar. So, should investors think about buying  Apple stock  as we close in on 2019?\\n Wednesday's Rally \\nApple and many other stocks were the beneficiaries of the largest-ever post-Christmas rally  for U.S. stocks. The Dow closed trading up 4.98%, or 1,086.25 points higher at 22,878.45. Wednesday's surge marked the biggest upward percentage climb since March of 2009 for the 30-stock index. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 jumped 4.96% and the Nasdaq Composite popped 5.84%-both of which also marked their best one-day moves, on a percentage basis, since March 2009.\\nCitron Research and Andrew Left's new bullish outlook on Facebook helped FB stock surge. Likewise, AMZN stock jumped after Amazon boasted that its customers made more purchases worldwide than ever before during the holiday season (also read: Amazon Posts Record-Breaking Holiday Sales: Time to Buy AMZN Stock?  and Citron Turns Bullish: Buy Facebook Stock in 2019?  ).\\nShares of Apple jumped 7.04% to reach $157.17 a share. Despite Wednesday's climb, Apple stock still rests roughly 32% below its 52-week high, which could present a potentially strong buying opportunity for those high on Apple.\\n Overview \\nApple stock began to tumble after the company announced that it would no longer report iPhone unit sales, among other products. This seemed to confirm a long-standing worry that Apple's days of massive growth in its most important segment are over-at least for now.\\nInvestors also recently reacted negatively to a Chinese court's ruling that called for a sales ban on some older iPhone models in the world's second-largest economy. It is, however, unclear if and when this ban will actually be put into action. On top of that, Apple's high prices have prevented its iPhones from gaining much traction in potentially key and massive markets such as India.\\n Outlook \\nLast quarter, Apple's iPhone revenues jumped 29% to help total company revenues climb 20%. However, iPhone unit sales came in flat from the year-ago period. Therefore, Apple's overall growth came mostly from its new higher-priced iPhones. But going forward the company will be report growth against periods that were already positively impacted by the pricing of the iPhone X and newer devices.\\nLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Apple's quarterly revenues to pop just 3.4% to reach $ 91.26 billion. The company's fiscal 2019 revenues are expected to jump 4.4% to hit $277.17 billion. Peaking ahead to the following fiscal year, Apple's revenues are expected to climb 3.9% above our current year estimate to hit $287.95 billion.\\nClearly, this is slower growth than Apple has experienced in the recent past. But investors might be pleased to see that Apple's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to surge nearly 20%. Meanwhile, the iPhone giants full-year EPS figure is expected to pop 10.7%. Plus, Apple's earnings are projected to come in 11.50% above our current-year estimate in the next fiscal year.\\n Bottom Line \\nApple's own success has made it harder for the company to report large, year over year revenue gains on a percentage basis. Yet, Apple looks poised to become more profitable as it fights to expand into new growth areas. The company's services business, which features Apple Music, will continue to be watched closely by investors as the division fights Spotify SPOT  and others.\\nMaybe more importantly, Apple is projected to launch a streaming TV service as soon as 2019 in order to challenge Netflix, Amazon, Disney DIS  , and AT&T T  in what could be a nearly completely streaming entertainment age. On top of that, Apple could surprise Wall Street by diving into other sectors, or introducing a new, gaming-changing product-like it has in the past.\\nIn the end, it is up to investors to decide what to do with Apple. But AAPL stock rests well below its recent highs. Plus, Apple is currently trading at 11.1X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. This marked a nearly one-year low and a discount compared to its year-long high of 19.7X.\\n Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies   \\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nLost in the market's pre-holiday sea of red was a 5% pop in the price of struggling Chinese e-commerce giant JD (NASDAQ: JD ) after reports that founder and CEO Liu Qiangdong won't face rape charges in Minnesota. The allegations were just one of a myriad of issues hanging over JD stock, issues that have driven JD stock down 54.4% this year versus the 10.8% drop in the\\xa0 Nasdaq Composite index\\nTo be sure, many of the issues which have plagued JD stock, much like the CEO rape allegations, are not about the company's fundamentals. That means that JD shares won't stay down forever. Instead, near-term pain should eventually turn into long-term gain.\\nBut, those issues don't get fixed because the CEO has cleared his name. Yes, it's a step in the right direction. But, it's not a panacea. As such, don't expect much improvement any time soon.\\nThe issues which have plagued JD stock in 2018 didn't start with Liu rape allegations, nor do they end there. Instead, this company has faced a myriad of issues all year long.\\nFirst and foremost, the Chinese economy is slowing. There were some cracks starting to show in early 2018. Throughout the year, those cracks became more noticeable, and today, the China economy is significantly slower than it was at the beginning of the year.\\nThis huge slowdown is at the heart of JD's struggles. From 2015 through 2017, JD was a 40%-plus revenue growth e-commerce company with expanding margins, and those favorable characteristics drew comparisons to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). But, those comps faltered this year. As the China economy slowed, so did JD's growth rates. Revenue growth started the year off weak at just 33% in the first quarter. Things only got weaker as the year progressed. Last quarter, revenue growth was 25%. Next quarter, it's expected to be 20%.\\n\\nMeanwhile, JD's margin expansion narrative that everyone thought was going to continue for the next several years, has all of a sudden disappeared. Management has been making big investments in 2018 in new growth initiatives like logistics, cloud, and international expansion. While these investments position the company for long-term success, they also eat into margins today, to the point where JD's margins have actually dropped substantially in 2018.\\nOverall, JD stock has been hammered by much more than the CEO rape allegations. While the Minnesota rape investigation's fade into the rear-view mirror is a positive, it's no panacea for what ails the stock. Things need to improve on the operational front before the JD share price sees a meaningful rebound.\\nTo be sure, the operational issues plaguing JD stock are fixable.\\nRevenue growth? It's stalling out because of a slowdown in China's economy and perhaps some domestic e-commerce market saturation. Even if these headwinds persists, revenue growth should have some tailwinds kick up soon to push growth higher. Namely, JD is expanding internationally, specifically, into the U.S. and Europe, two markets that could be huge opportunities for the Chinese e-commerce player. True, those markets are already loaded with e-commerce players, but JD's China credentials presents a unique advantage that could resonate well with western consumers.\\nAlso, revenue growth should get a boost from expansion into secular growth markets like cloud. That new cloud growth combined with e-retail expansion, should help revenue growth pick up in 2019, and perhaps accelerate back to 30%-plus rates in the future.\\nMargin expansion? That, too, should re-enter the fold. JD has made very clear that this was going to be an investment year with depressed margins. We've seen this rodeo before, with Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), and other hyper-growth giants. Invest big today. Take a hit on margins. Grow the business. Scale back investments. Margins track higher.\\nThe same should play out with JD. As this company expands its global footprint and develops a sizable cloud presence, expansion-related investments should peel back. As they do, margins will trend higher, and they will do so on a substantially larger revenue base, meaning huge profit growth potential.\\nNone of this is priced into JD stock yet, meaning the shares could rally in a big way once its other issues get fixed.\\nThe Wall Street Journal \\xa0last week described the decision not to bring charges against Lio brought to a close a turbulent period for the founder of the e-commerce site since he was accused of rape in late August. For investors, this is a\\xa0a step in the right direction but it's not the catalyst that gets JD stock back on a long-term uptrend.\\nInstead, that boost will be improving operational fundamentals. Revenue growth trends need to turn around, and margins need to stabilize. Those two things will happen, just not now. As such, JD stock likely won't bounce back any time soon.\\nAs of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and NFLX.\\xa0\\nThe post Things Still Aren't Pretty For JD Stock Holders But They Will Get Better appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Cash is   constantly becoming less convenient to use, and cashless   technologies like person-to-person (P2P) payment apps, mobile   payment solutions, and more are evolving rapidly.\\nTo be fair, the entire financial industry could benefit from   this transition. For example, even brick-and-mortar banks could   see profits rise, as mobile deposits and other   technology-assisted transactions are far more cost-effective than   paying a teller to assist customers. Having said that, there are   a few companies that have the potential to be especially big   winners. Here\\'s a great group of four disruptive companies, which   I\\'ll collectively refer to as the \"war on cash\" basket (thanks to   my   colleague Jason Moser    ), that are leading the transformation of the financial   industry.\\n  \\nImage source: Square.\\n Square    (NYSE: SQ) has already done a lot to transform the financial   industry. Its core business of producing affordable payment   processing solutions has helped make credit card acceptance more   widespread than ever before, and in places you would have never   thought possible just a few years ago. For example, I used to   have to make a trip to the ATM before visiting my local craft   market, but Square has helped make such a trip unnecessary.\\nIn addition, Square Capital has made it easier for businesses   to meet their funding needs, and Square Cash has made   person-to-person payments easier and also introduced a new subset   of the population to bitcoin and the idea of a   cryptocurrency.\\nGoing forward, there are two major reasons I\\'m excited about   Square. First, the company plans to reapply for a   banking license    . Not only would this make their existing lending business more   profitable by cutting out the middleman, but it would also open   the door to lots of new possibilities -- like a personal lending   platform, perhaps.\\nSecond and most significantly, the   Cash App    and its millions of active users haven\\'t really been monetized   yet. Square has said that it would love to become an all-in-one   financial services company for its customers -- think deposit   accounts, investment products, loans, and more. The company   already has millions of potential banking customers in its   ecosystem.\\nI\\'m grouping payment processing giants   Visa    (NYSE: V) and   Mastercard    (NYSE: MA) into the same section because I consider them to be   about 95% the same investment. There are some small differences,   but for the most part, the answers to the questions \"What does   Visa do?\" and \"What does Mastercard do?\" are largely the   same.\\nIt\\'s tough to argue that   any    companies have had more of an impact on the financial lives of   Americans over the past few decades. In fact, I\\'d bet that almost   everyone reading this has a Visa- or Mastercard-branded credit or   debit card in their wallet right now.\\nIt might surprise you to learn that both companies are still   growing impressively. During the   third quarter    , Visa\\'s payment volume was up 11% and revenue grew by 12%. In   Mastercard\\'s case    , the growth was 13% and 15%, respectively, for these two   metrics.\\nAt this point, Visa and Mastercard still have a lot of   potential to disrupt the financial industry internationally.   While Americans are used to near-universal credit card acceptance   at this point, that\\'s simply not the case in many parts of the   world. Many areas of Asia and Latin America still don\\'t widely   use card payments. This is why cross-border transaction revenue   is up by 17% year over year for both companies, and I don\\'t see   this figure slowing down as long as the war on cash is still   going on.\\n PayPal    (NASDAQ: PYPL) has certainly come a long way since it was a   subsidiary of eBay that simply facilitated online payment   transactions. As if its original function wasn\\'t disruptive   enough, PayPal has continued to change the way consumers pay for   things online, especially in regards to mobile and in-app   payments.\\nIf you think   PayPal\\'s growth    has peaked, think again. In the third quarter of 2018, PayPal\\'s   total payment volume increased by 24% year over year, fueled by a   massive 45% jump in mobile payment volume and 78% growth in the   company\\'s ultra-successful Venmo P2P payment platform.\\nNow, even looking beyond Venmo, PayPal is certainly a   competitor to Square in many ways, such as its acquisition of   iZettle (often known as the \"Square of Europe\") earlier this   year, and its free Funds Now feature for merchants, which is an   obvious effort to compete with Square\\'s Instant Deposit. However,   it\\'s important to realize that the cashless payments industry is   massive    . There\\'s plenty of room for both companies to grow tremendously   from their current size.\\nOn The Motley Fool\\'s    Industry Focus: Financials     podcast, host Jason Moser and I often collectively refer to these   four stocks as the \"war on cash\" basket. In a nutshell, the idea   is that there\\'s a ton of room to grow for all four of these   stocks, so it could be smart to invest in all four instead of   banking on the success of just one. There\\'s a clear trend toward   a cashless society all over the world, and these four companies   are likely to be big winners.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Visa       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nAll good things must come to an end. And while we don't know   for certain when the next recession will occur, we do know it   will eventually hit. When the economy turns sour and people have   to be more cautious about their spending, which streaming   companies are likely to remain strongest?   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) ?   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Amazon Prime Video? Upcoming efforts from   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,   Disney    (NYSE: DIS) , and   AT&T    's (NYSE: T) WarnerMedia?\\nThere are reasons to believe that the cord-cutting revolution   that has bolstered streaming companies will continue apace during   a recession -- cord-cutting is supposed to be a cost-saving   measure, after all. But there are fewer reasons to believe that   recession-curtailed spending will support the kind of diverse   ecosystem of streaming services that is forming now. A CNBC   survey found that most Americans -- 57% -- have at least one   streaming subscription, but   less than half that number have more than one    . Even affordable niche streaming services -- ideal, in theory,   for supplementing another on-demand video subscription --   have had trouble making profits    and are, in some cases,   being shut down    .\\n  \\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nWith new streaming on-demand services from Disney and   WarnerMedia on the horizon, there are about to be a whole lot of   streaming services for consumers to choose from. That sounds   enticing, but people will likely be even less willing to splurge   on multiple streaming subscriptions during a recession. So if it   comes down to a recession-fueled zero-sum streaming game, which   services would fare best? Let's take a look.\\nAn established user base matters, and Netflix has one.   Netflix's user base   tops 137 million    , which is more than any other subscription streaming service can   claim. Only Amazon's Prime Video comes close, but that's largely   because it is tied into a regular Amazon Prime subscription. The   number of viewers reached by Amazon Prime Video is lower than the   Prime subscriber count; estimates have placed it at around 26   million in the past, which was about 31% of the contemporary   Prime subscriber count. Assuming the same penetration and updated   Prime estimates, Amazon's streaming service would reach more than   31 million users today -- impressive but still short of Netflix's   figures.\\nUnless other services can find a way to convince more   consumers to invest in more than one streaming service at once,   making headway in the streaming market will have to mean chipping   away at Netflix's user base. Netflix seems best positioned by far   to weather an economic recession given that so many people   already are in its monthly subscription program.\\nAmazon Prime Video does have the advantage of being a   cost-effective solution -- something that could serve it well in   a recession.\\nAn Amazon Prime membership costs $119 per year or $12.99 per   month. That's right around the price of the most popular Netflix   plan, which is $10.99 per month. But Amazon Prime Video is, of   course, just one part of an Amazon Prime subscription, which also   includes such perks as streaming music and free two-day shipping   on many products in Amazon's marketplace. The shopping-related   perks could be key to keeping members during a recession as Prime   members feel they are getting deals.\\nThree huge companies have streaming video on demand services   planned for 2019: Disney, Apple, and (through subsidiary   WarnerMedia) AT&T. Can these services make a dent in   Netflix's dominance? Perhaps -- but a recession could throw a   serious wrench into their plans.\\nCompeting with Netflix means spending big. Apple is making a   $1 billion investment in original content. AT&T and Disney   are both able to create streaming services on this scale because   of major acquisitions they made -- acquisitions that already seem   like relics of past economic times, as the low interest rates   that fueled 2018's merger mania are expected to keep rising. The   firepower these new streaming services are bringing will make   life interesting for Netflix execs, but if consumer confidence   and spending wane ahead of or soon after these new services' 2019   release dates, that could play into the hands of the more   established Netflix and Amazon.\\nNo streaming service will benefit in the short term from an   economic recession and a reduction in consumer spending. But if a   recession must come, there are worse times for Netflix and Amazon   to see one. A penny-pinching population could make next year's   competitive streaming market very rough on the newcomers, while   inertia and shopping-related value-adds work to keep Netflix and   Amazon on top of the streaming market.\\n \\n Find out why Apple is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now \\nMotley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent     more than a decade beating the market.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nFor Immediate Release\\nChicago, IL - December 27, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: AT&T T , Walt Disney DIS , Viacom VIAB and Netflix NFLX .\\nHere are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:\\nCan Stiff Competition Derail Disney's Box Office Rule in 2019?\\nThe preceding festive weekend saw what it had expected to see - packed theatres and record-hitting domestic box-office sales for the big-ticket releases.\\nAquaman , a production of AT&T's Warner Bros., raked in record sales of $67.4 million and still counting at the North American box office. Walt Disney's Mary Poppins Returns was right behind with $23.5 million weekend collection at the domestic box office.\\nMeanwhile, Bumblebee grabbed the third position, fetching an estimated $21.6 million during the weekend for Viacom's Paramount at the domestic box office.\\nDisney Dominates 2018\\nEven though Aquaman grossed about $483 million worldwide since its release on Dec 14, almost 10 times more than the estimated $51 million that Mary Poppins Returns made globally since its Dec 19 release, the year was ruled by Disney films.\\nEarlier this month, Disney Animation's flick Ralph Breaks the Internet reached the zenith of the top 10 weekend domestic box-office estimates, enabling the company to achieve the worldwide $7-billion mark year to date as of Dec 10.\\nIn January 2018, Disney's Black Panther alone generated $700 million in domestic sales to become the third-highest blockbuster in the United States.\\nPer Box Office Mojo, with $3 billion year-to-date collection at the domestic box office, Disney's Buena Vista studio currently captures the maximum share of the Studio market at 26.3% compared with Warner Bros.' 15.6%.\\nAll in all, 2018 is undoubtedly proving to be a great year for the domestic box office. Per Hollywood Reporter, the 2018 domestic box office is heading for a record haul and is projected to hit $12 billion. With another holiday weekend to go before the year ends, it remains to be seen how the box office ushers in 2019.\\nStrong Lineup for 2019\\nThe interesting line-up of Disney movies next year including Captain Marvel , Dumbo , Aladdin , The Lion King , Toy Story 4 and the next Avengers film is expected to deliver yet another year of massive hits.\\xa0 The Avengers: Infinity War had made a whopping $258 million on its opening weekend domestically. This in turn, augurs well for the success of its sequel in the series. The Lion King as a classic favorite is also a much-anticipated film lined up for the following year.\\nWhile the Disney package looks attractive, Warner Bros.' The LEGO Movie 2 , Detective Pikachu , Minecraft and the next of The Conjuring series appear quite promising for the company. Considering the smash hit The Nun , which logged around $54 million at the domestic box office on its opening weekend in September, the next film of The Conjuring series too seems to be a much-touted one.\\nSevere Competition Dictates Strict Measures\\nEven though the box office is dominated by Disney, the company faces stiff rivalry in other areas that it operates in. Disney is expected to launch its online streaming service in late 2019 to counter competition from established players in the market, namely Netflix and Amazon Prime.\\nThe streaming service is said to feature content from Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and National Geographic. Additionally, Disney is working on building its original content portfolio for its streaming service.\\nDisney's planned acquisition of a majority of 21st Century Fox's assets will significantly expand its content portfolio and is expected to boost the company's competitive edge against Netflix and Amazon Prime.\\nMoreover, AT&T is expected to invest heavily in HBO that further intensifies competition in the content market. Further, a strong line-up of movies from the likes of Warner Bros. and Paramount is likely to make it difficult for Disney to repeat its 2018-like dominance.\\nDisney currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\\nBoth AT&T and Viacom carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\\nThe Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus | The Walt Disney Company Quote\\nToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies\\nIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.\\nAnd this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.\\nSee Them Free>>\\nMedia Contact\\nZacks Investment Research\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\nsupport@zacks.com\\nhttp://www.zacks.com\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n2018 seems to be ending on a bad note in the markets. December is setting the wrong kind of records, and Q4 has been a bumpy one in general. This is what happens in the stock market sometimes, but it\\'s been easy to forget over the decade-long bull market.\\nWe\\'re using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we\\'re inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you.\\nOur Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We\\'ll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative investing strategies, Biotech, and the Macro outlook.\\nThis roundtable looks at tech, which led the market higher and is doing so again lower, with the Nasdaq hitting a bear market in the last full week of the year. What\\'s going on? We asked our panel to make sense of the situation:\\nTom Lloyd: Deviation from the mean describes almost perfectly what is happening to the Tech Stocks. Just take a look at the monthly charts for Apple ( AAPL ) and Netflix ( NFLX ) and you can see how irrationally the market, the ETFs and the robot trading had moved price to unsustainable highs. The efficient market eventually kicks in and price returns to the mean. I am looking for bargains where the pullback is overdone and in 3 to 5 years the stocks will double. I am just waiting for the bottoms to be confirmed so I can put them back in my model portfolio once again.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: Tech was doing great in 2017 and the first half of 2018 but hit a brick wall in the third quarter. We told subscribers to be hedged through just about all of October, November and December because we saw that earnings growth was peaking. Earnings drive stock prices. Q3 ended up being even worse than we expected. Q4 should be no different. Be careful.\\nDamon Verial: In the short term, it certainly does feel like the NASDAQ hasn\\'t been doing well. But as stated, tech stocks are actually up as a whole. The fear right now is a product of the recency illusion: That this time is different. In fact, every bull market has corrections, and these corrections are healthy for their ability to prevent real bubbles, such as that of 2000. As the economic environment is still one of growth, I am confident that this current pullback is a mere correction and not a repeat of 2000.\\nMichael Wiggins De Oliveira: It has been a year of two halves. In the first half of 2018, tech stocks were fashionably in favor. It became a brainless transaction for many market participants. But towards the back end of 2018, there has been a slightly more subdued market. Now, here is the thing, while many investors are panicking, and while the market has been swift in its sell-off, it has not been, overall, all that bad. There are still plenty of names, such as Amazon ( AMZN ) and Netflix, which still carry egregious valuations. Yes, there are some pockets which have been grounded slightly, like Nvidia ( NVDA ), but even then, these slightly cheaper opportunities are not yet trading in the bargain basement. Overall, the market is still very expensive - contrary to most investors\\' opinion.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: Regardless of green or red, 2018 is going to go down as a defining year for tech in terms of privacy and security. Facebook ( FB ) bore the brunt of it this year and I think they\\'ll continue to do so; but Google ( GOOG ) and Apple may find themselves under fire with recent reports on apps tracking locations. Tech is still seen as a major good in American life, but tides are changing where the size, scope, and microeconomics that these companies support are going to come into questions of fear from users. Companies are going to have to both invest in privacy in 2019 and assure users of it; bringing spikes in investments here and/or changes in business strategy that relies heavily on targeted advertisement.\\nJoe Albano: Tech has seen a myriad of factors play into its ups and downs with much of it balancing out to a neutral sentiment albeit barely green year overall. Social media stocks such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter ( TWTR ) are feeling the effects of incidents and allegations brought to light throughout the year leaving them in a flat-to-down return for the year. On the other hand, software has seen a pretty stable year as tariffs on physical items haven\\'t affected these companies nearly as directly - companies like CyberArk ( CYBR ), FireEye ( FEYE ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ). Hardware has seen the best of times and the worst of times this year. Many 52-week highs were made just a few months ago including Nvidia and Apple, both of which dealing with retail-sided pressure. Tech performance overall has fragmented forcing investors to find where the pockets of strength are. It\\'s not as easy as filling the shopping cart with everything from aisle 4, and so this is where the advantage of knowing the industry to know what will perform well comes into play.\\nApp Economy Insights: I don\\'t look at the market on a calendar year basis and would rather focus on where we are in the credit cycle. While 2018 might look almost flat, there is a much bigger story here. On December 20th, for the first time since 2008, the NASDAQ entered bear market territory, falling more than 20% from its record reached at the end of August. This bear market was much needed after a 10-year bull run. I welcome it as a great time for opportunities to put new money to work. Investors who maintain a diversified portfolio and stay invested so they experience the subsequent recovery should not be harmed. Remaining focused on the long term is an important thing to do when in the middle of a bear market.\\nB&B Market: The majority of 2018 has been a strong year for technology companies, however hectic is a great word to summarize the year. The NASDAQ had returned 15% as of the beginning of October but has lost 17% in the last 2 months, making the YTD return about -5% as of this writing. This year, the markets were plagued by privacy scandals, government attacks, and a trade war as some notable events. The markets became extremely volatile near the end of the year and I foresee the beginning of 2019 to act similarly.\\nMatt Bohlsen: 2018 for tech has been a tale of two halves - H1 2018 was good, and H2 2018 has been bad. In particular, late 2018 has seen risk-off sentiment due to the US-China trade war and rising US rates. Fundamentals have not really changed, except for greater regulator scrutiny on the way tech companies use customers\\' data and some slowdown in the tech giants\\' growth rates which was to be expected.\\nBilly Duberstein: Well... it ain\\'t green anymore as of 12/20 as I write this! I think the word I\\'d use to describe 2018 is \"Whipsaw.\" Tech is a mixture of high-growth, high-multiple software companies and cyclical chip/hardware stocks. In the wake of the 2017 tax cuts, U.S. growth accelerated, leading to blowout results and fueling optimism. Then, Trump started the trade war with China in the Spring, which has, at least rhetorically, escalated since that time. In addition, the October Bloomberg Businessweek article about Chinese hacking of Super Micro Computer motherboards called into question the security of much of the tech supply chain. Then, just as soon as we get a trade \"truce\" in early December, the Canadians arrest the CFO of Huawei for violating Iran sanctions. These tensions fueled fears that a wrench would be thrown into global trade generally and the tech supply chain specifically. Add in the Fed going somewhat on autopilot with rate hikes, and all of that growth optimism has reversed (killing cyclicals) while investors began to use higher discount rate assumptions (killing high P/E growth stocks at the same time). So, there was a huge whipsaw in sentiment from extremely positive in 1H to extremely negative in the matter of a few months. \"Whipsaw!\" Quite a change from the low-volatility environment we were in last year.\\nMark Hibben: It was a good year up until the beginning of October. Then a number of factors converged that caused the market to sell off many tech companies. There was weak earnings guidance from companies such as Apple and Nvidia. There was fear that the trade war would hurt, both directly and indirectly, companies that do business in China or which have production in China. Bloomberg\\'s The Big Hack, which alleged that the Chinese had infiltrated the data centers of companies like Amazon through modified server hardware, seemed to heighten the paranoia concerning China. And there were numerous analyst warnings about a \"chip slowdown\" which the media applied indiscriminately to all semiconductor companies. The combined effect has been to drive many companies negative on the year. However, many of these companies represent buying opportunities, and I plan on making purchases in 2019.\\nTom Lloyd: No, the story has not changed and the only thing that has changed is price and how cheap you can buy them. I keep thinking about how Warren Buffett was smart enough to buy Apple at the very bottom. Now we will have that opportunity with all of the FAANG stocks. I don\\'t see one loser, but obviously some stocks are going to stay bottoming longer than others.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: They seemed to all slow in Q3 for different reasons. I think it\\'s safe to stay away as long as their growth rates continue to contract. High multiple stocks with contracting growth rates is not a pretty formula. Usually it takes at least 4 quarters for a company to work out of a slowing trend. But you can\\'t just buy in four quarters. You\\'d first need some inkling that something\\'s improving.\\nDamon Verial: FAANG is a coin termed by Jim Cramer, who has been shown statistically to be wrong more often than right. As an analyst with mainstream appeal, Jim Cramer gains more from speaking about popular stocks than stocks that are likely to outperform. I don\\'t choose my plays by the popularity of the stock but by the probability that the stock will move in a certain direction.\\nMichael Wiggins De Oliveira: FAANGs make for a catchy name. However, that\\'s all it is, nothing more than a journalistic sounding name. Because, for instance, even within the FAANGs themselves, there are huge valuation discrepancies. For example, no rational and experienced investor should make the argument that Apple and Amazon should be similarly valued. Yet currently we find them trading with similar market caps. More specifically, we know that Amazon\\'s Q4 2018 results are guided to post revenue growth of between 10%-20%. While presently, investors are pricing in substantially higher growth. On the other hand, Apple is growing its top line around 15%, yet investors are not willing to pay more than 15 times earnings. And remember, Apple has a rock solid balance sheet and an accelerated share repurchase program which has more than $50 billion allocated for repurchases over the near to medium-term. Amazon, on the other hand, carries a weak balance sheet with debt and capital leases and yet investors are willing to pay more than 90 times its earnings. In summary, the story has not changed as much as investors believe. Amazon was in favor at the start of 2018 and it still is. Apple, Facebook and Alphabet were cheap earlier in the year and they still are. The only question mark could be around Netflix. While it appears that its bubble may have started to deflate, it\\'s too soon to call it one way or another. For now, Netflix is still very much in favor with investors.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook is the first to feel the burn of this, but I think others will soon. Social Media is so reliant on data-based microtargeting because it has few other inherent value propositions in terms of revenue; but Google may have some of this coming, as well as Amazon, who took the lead in 2018 in product search.\\nJoe Albano: All for one and one for all is the best way to sum it up. Facebook\\'s issues aren\\'t affecting Netflix, but Netflix is down almost 40% from its July highs while its business looks pretty decent on a subscriber momentum basis. Amazon has had its political struggles, down 25% since its highs. Each has had their unique struggles but being the largest companies traded, it\\'s easy to deflate these stock prices first especially as high valuation leaders (exceptions of course). They all have their own problems, but they all seem to affect each other - the answer is they each represent a leading and relevant facet of our society. Therefore, one weakened pillar supposes the idea the other pillars are not far behind.\\nApp Economy Insights: To a certain extent, the air that came out of FAANG is mean reversion working its magic. Investors should not reasonably expect a +20% year time and time again. Google, Apple, Amazon have built platforms and ecosystems that developers, publishers and consumers will probably rely on for the decades to come. Government regulation has been the theme in 2018 for social media giants like Google and Facebook. More of these growing pains should be expected in the coming years. These are necessary steps in their outstanding growth stories. It might create a lower ceiling than expected on their overall potential, but it will create an even stronger moat around their leading positions. \\nDavid Pinsen: I think the business story is still the tension between their moats as oligopolies and the threat (however small in the near term) of antitrust or other regulatory action against them. Amazon increasing its minimum wage in the U.S. to $15 per hour (nearly double the current federal minimum wage) can be seen as an attempt to ward this off.\\nMatt Bohlsen: Facebook has seen user growth slow down or stall especially in developed markets such as the US and Europe; however, developing markets such as Asia are still growing well. Amazon has seen their revenue growth rate slow. Apple is seeing a slowdown in global smartphone sales. Netflix sales growth is still strong and doing well from a smaller base than those mentioned above. Alphabet growth has slowed. What this all tells us is that the % growth of the very large FAANG stocks has slowed, with the smaller Netflix as the exception. It is like China GDP - the growth rate % can slow, but due to the massive size, the raw number growth is still impressive. Investors will need to expect a bit lower (but still positive) rates of return on big tech going forward. Valuations have been adjusting in H2 2018, and are now closer to fair value, and worth starting to accumulate again.\\nBilly Duberstein: Stories are always changing with FAANG, which is why these huge companies are so interesting, but the most significant story change is indeed Facebook. The degree to which the story has changed is unclear, but there are now some legitimate questions around the business model. Facebook is still very profitable and growing, but there is a big concern around how much it will have to spend to police its platform and if the margins of the company are now structurally lower, or if the margin contraction next year will be a one-off. There is also some concern around data privacy. I\\'m not sure if the company\\'s ads will be quite as effective if users withhold meaningful data from the company (I suspect they will still be pretty effective though). But I don\\'t think there will be much defection from the platforms. Thank God the company also bought Instagram, which most users probably don\\'t even know is owned by the same company. Instagram really seems to be doing well and beating Snapchat at its own game. There\\'s also some personality drama around Zuckerberg and Sandberg, but I don\\'t think the average user or advertiser cares that much about that stuff. I lean towards Facebook turning out okay in the long run, but my confidence in Facebook is admittedly now the lowest of the FAANGs. Since the others have now all sold off as well this month (Facebook fell first), I\\'d prefer the other FAANGs to Facebook, though I didn\\'t necessarily think that some months ago when the others were relatively more expensive. That being said, these companies all remain incredible businesses and I think all are probably good long-term buys after the recent swoon, Facebook being the riskiest.\\nMark Hibben: FAANG is kind of a convenience category and these companies don\\'t always have a much in common. I\\'ve never been a fan of the ad supported social media companies such as Facebook and Google. I consider Netflix still overvalued, although it\\'s not as bad as it was. Apple and Amazon I consider to be interesting \"new paradigm\" semiconductor companies. New paradigm companies design their own processors rather than buy from commodity vendors such as Intel. Apple has been doing this for years for its iOS devices, and Amazon recently joined the ranks of the new paradigm when it announced that it was deploying custom designed ARM processors in its data centers. Although the recent downturn has certainly affected their valuations, I don\\'t think it\\'s changed my fundamental takes on these companies. The social media companies are mainly about merchandising personal information. This is becoming more of an issue, and I don\\'t think it\\'s an issue that can be solved without fairly dramatic change to their business models. I avoid social media companies, but consider the new paradigm to be the wave of the future in semiconductors.\\nJuan Carlos Zuleta: I beg to differ - I am instead of the opinion that the second half of the year and in particular the last three months of 2018 was bad for FAANG because all of reasons that triggered the fall of their stocks occurred beginning July. Here I am talking about Facebook\\'s scandal over data privacy; Amazon\\'s Q3 earnings report; Apple\\'s legal battle with Qualcomm ( QCOM ); Netflix\\'s drop in subscriber growth due to competition; and Google\\'s European fine over security flaws.\\nHans Hauge: Facebook has become a tech dinosaur. I think what we\\'re seeing now is their slow decline. Just talk to any kid on the street and ask them what they think of Facebook. They\\'ll tell you it\\'s just not cool anymore. Besides that, people who are interested in privacy jumped ship long ago, and the rest of the population is only hanging around because, well there\\'s nowhere better to go yet. Does that mean Facebook is a bad investment? I\\'m not saying that, they could continue to make money, good money even; despite being long in the tooth.\\nTom Lloyd: Facebook is probably dead money for 2019, but once it moves off the bottom, I think it will zoom back to making new highs. Unfortunately, it has enormous challenges, but I think Zuckerberg has shown he knows how to handle challenges. Facebook is in dry dock for repairs to its leaky boat, but be ready for the launch and a less leaky boat making the trip around the world and taking Facebook back to new highs and beyond. Facebook becomes even more important in a recession as users spend more time on it. Ad budgets will be cut during a recession, but Facebook may take more market share, rather than less. I think they will beat Google.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: I think this is getting worse. The company guided now two quarters in a row specifically citing a slowdown in revenue growth. Based on what Mark Zuckerberg has said publicly that 2019 will be a tough year I think this trend can continue to worsen. Facebook has a problem. They are trying to muscle their core customer\\'s usage habits from passive consumption back to social engagement. Typically they\\'ve done a good job chasing consumer habits. Now they are trying to change them? This is not a safe stock. We are below the Street for earnings.\\nDamon Verial: Facebook is safe. The company has a monopoly on social media advertising and arguably the best customer metrics in the industry. As a former digital marketer, I\\'ve used practically every digital advertisement vendor on the internet, and Facebook stands out as the best in terms of specific targeting. While Google advertisements get you more exposure, Facebook offers marketers the ability to target virtually any specific group intersection (e.g., newly wed women in their 20s who are interested in cosmetics). Some analysts consider Google and Facebook competitors, but the truth is both of these companies are monopolies in their given niche and can operate alongside each other, provided Google Plus never gets big or Facebook never creates a search engine. As the marketing becomes increasingly digital, stealing revenue from television, radio, and the like, both Facebook and Google should continue to grow their revenue and earnings.\\nMichael Wiggins De Oliveira: Facebook is my best idea among the tech stocks. There is no scenario where the stock is not undervalued. Pick any metric. Most investors could not seriously expect Facebook to continue to grow in the medium term at plus 40% year-over-year as it has been. Those days are gone. But what\\'s left?\\nWell, it\\'s my strong contention that Facebook can grow above 20% year-over-year over the next 2-3 years. Having said that, most investors are fearful (understandably) of Facebook\\'s elevated operational expenses, which are going to hit between 40%-50% in 2019 - worse case assumption Facebook\\'s FY 2019 operating expenses will reach $47 billion. In other words, Facebook\\'s operating income will hover around $27 billion. Is that so bad? For a company priced at $420 billion market cap? This implies that Facebook is being priced at roughly 15 times operating income. And we should remember, that Facebook\\'s balance sheet carries around $40 billion of cash and equivalents (and no debt). Moreover, two further aspects need to be brought to the front of the thesis. Facebook is an extremely asset-light business, where 30% of its revenue ends up as free cash flow. In essence, Facebook is not a capital intensive business, where a large portion of its earnings need to be reinvested, no. Not at all. And finally, investors should recognise that Facebook has increased its allocation for share repurchases by $9 billion to $24 billion. If this is not a sign of management\\'s confidence in the business, I don\\'t know what is.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: It\\'ll rebound and have enough capital to reinvent itself (I believe they still have no debt on their books) - but it\\'ll need to find a way to repair its image with the young people who are active on mobile but also more conscious of what\\'s happening in the tech arena.\\nJoe Albano: Facebook has been mired in PR report after PR report - none of which have been positive. The media is doing much the same they do in politics - if they don\\'t like you, it doesn\\'t matter what is happening, you\\'re wrong. Also much like the media, when they move onto their next target, the last target falls to the wayside. 2019 could be that transition to the next target while Facebook works toward its goal of moving toward Stories and Messenger (also WhatsApp) revenue. If both happen, then Facebook will be on the map again for stock price appreciation.\\nApp Economy Insights: The story that has changed the most during 2018 has certainly been Facebook amid scandals of election meddling, private information usage, and management transparency. There will be consequences that will soon unravel: regulations will come with additional costs for the company to keep its platforms in check, some of the revenue growth could suffer from tougher rules around private information, and the hidden costs of a much-needed re-shuffle of the leadership team given the way they have handled PR.\\nFor 2019 and beyond, Facebook remains an outstanding business that is bigger than the sum of its parts. They are learning the hard way but will come out much stronger on the other side, with new rules and standards that will be very hard to replicate for any newcomer. Remember: even Google wasn\\'t able to build a sustainable social media platform.\\nB&B Market: Facebook is a stock that has been abused this year. The company has been involved in multiple privacy scandals, on its main platform and on others such as WhatsApp. However, the stock is currently trading at very attractive multiples compared to historical norms. While I am not personally a user of Facebook, I see the data showing that it is a booming business. Users are reaching all-time highs, ad-revenue is strong, and the company is actively diversifying its business line into other segments such as VR and competitors like the Instagram acquisition. The market has beaten the stock down in 2018, I see this reversing in the future. Valuation wise, this is a strong opportunity to buy in my opinion.\\nDavid Pinsen: Of the FAANGs, Facebook would be the most vulnerable to antitrust action, because its core platform has been in decline, and it has depended on acquisitions (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp) to attract users. Whether there will be any antitrust action against it in 2019, I don\\'t know, but the company faces other challenges regardless, such as the lawsuits by video advertisers.\\nMatt Bohlsen: Facebook platform overall user growth will slow, but monetisation across their various platforms should improve. Further data scrutiny and some fines can be expected. Overall, 2019 should see a solid but not spectacular year for Facebook with the stock price recovering to back above USD 150 and probably closer to USD 175, assuming no significant global slowdown and poor sentiment.\\nBilly Duberstein: 2019 should be flat earnings on higher spending. The big question is if the company can moderate spending and continue to raise ad prices in 2020 and beyond to rejuvenate operating leverage. It will be interesting to see how long the terrible headlines last for Facebook - there seems to be a new one each week and I don\\'t see that changing in the near-term unfortunately. How patient will investors be?\\nMark Hibben: Facebook usage appears to be on the decline, according to a recent Pew survey . I\\'m not convinced that more extensive privacy settings will be enough to solve Facebook\\'s fundamental problems of fake news and foreign exploitation. This is a problem not unique to Facebook, of course, but is general in social media.\\nJeffrey Himelson: I see regulatory measures disrupting its business model.\\nTom Lloyd: Tesla ( TSLA ) seems to be Teflon coated for the time being. By all accounts they should have gone bankrupt, but the stock keeps climbing to that $420 target of Elon Musk, just to prove the regulators were wrong and Elon was right. It is too risky and too overvalued for our model portfolio. Computer assisted driving is taking over all cars and Tesla is at the cutting edge here and in the electric car. This is the Tech story that will affect everyone that drives a car in the next 5 years.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: The trade war was just news until it hit earnings. Earnings are what drives stock prices and corporate CEOs all blinked slowing purchasing decisions in Q3 waiting for trade war resolution. Until that is resolved, I see tech continuing to slow. What bigger story is there?\\nDamon Verial: On the topic of Facebook, note that the company gains its data essentially for free, from its users\\' (not paying customers) devices. Facebook has come preinstalled on many phone brands for some time now, but a more recent development will allow the company to acquire even more detailed data. Before 2019, a new Android update (which will be automatic, without a permission prompt) will force users to allow the OS to continually update Facebook with your phone information, including SMS and call logs. Of course, Google has a hand in this because Android is its OS. The question is whether Google will be collecting data for their own use as well.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook and Cambridge Analytics and the fallout from that being seen elsewhere.\\nJoe Albano: The global economic story - it\\'s affecting everything including tech. But let\\'s not forget the front half of this year was quite good. There\\'s a lot of uncertainty in the back half of this year and it\\'s causing quick decisions by management in all companies to change investment directions and move to safer places. \\'Growth\\' and \\'safe\\' generally don\\'t go together. Growth requires investment and return on investment and that is being stagnated right now with the state of global affairs. The hope is this doesn\\'t trigger other events and economic faults to appear or the dominoes to fall but the preparation at the end of this year is to ready for it if it does.\\nApp Economy Insights: Coming from the video game industry, the biggest story of 2018 for me has been Fortnite from Epic Games (40% owned by Tencent ( TCEHY )). Following the success of Fortnite (more than 200 million registered users and $2 billion revenue in 2018), a new expectation of the way we play video games has emerged: cross-platform play, seamlessly syncing people playing on smartphones, PCs and consoles. Not only did Epic Games reveal a new store that will compete with STEAM and Google by disrupting the pricing model on PC and Android (challenging the status quo with a 12% distributor margin), they also announced they will launch free services designed to help developers implement cross-platform play into their games. This is more important than you might think: this paves the way for competitive games to become platform-agnostic and could make existing console hardware mostly irrelevant.\\nB&B Market: Funny enough, the biggest story had to have been the Chinese IP scandal that was just reported in mid-December. Reportedly, the Chinese government has been employing hackers to steal IP from American companies, codenamed \"Operation Cloudhopper\". This story encapsulates all the negative themes that we have seen in the tech markets throughout this year. There is malpractice from China, a break of privacy and law, and there is IP theft which has been a main driver of the US-China tensions. IBM and HP are among the affected and these reports will most likely be a direct impact on the outcome of the recent 90-day cease fire between the 2 nations. It is sure to be interesting to see how the current administration handles this report.\\nDavid Pinsen: Probably the precipitous declines in the esteems of Facebook\\'s CEO and COO. Sheryl Sandberg was mooted as Hillary Clinton\\'s likely Treasury Secretary had Mrs. Clinton won the election in 2016, and Mark Zuckerberg appeared to be testing the waters for a presidential run of his own before this year\\'s Facebook scandals.\\nMatt Bohlsen: The November launch by Alphabet of autonomous vehicles with no human driver in Phoenix, Arizona. The era of the robo-taxi has arrived. This can be a multi-billion dollar industry, and Alphabet\\'s Waymo is leading the way. It should also help boost electric vehicle sales as EV robo-taxi fleets are purchased. I expect it won\\'t be all smooth sailing, but disruptive change is never that way.\\nBilly Duberstein: I think the China trade war and concerns of hacking/cybersecurity, because so much of the global tech supply chain moves through China, and the issue has really escalated to the forefront of both the business and geopolitical news. How the trade talks play out will be really consequential for tech and could lead to a binary outcome for the Nasdaq next year. Will China and the U.S. find ways to collaborate and prosper together, or will each nation re-trench and engage in an adversarial tech arms race? I would think cooler heads would prevail and that each side would act in its best interest. However, nothing\\'s off the table for this administration or for China, for that matter, which has not been a good actor. On the positive/cool innovation front, you will begin to see the first 5G phones and deployments next year - though it will still be really early days for that. And, of course, the continuing trends of cloud computing/AI/IoT and more automation in every aspect of life both for consumers and enterprises, which is the most important story of this decade and era.\\nMark Hibben: I actually thought the AWS announcement of the custom ARM chip deployment was the most significant news of 2018. I\\'ve been expecting ARM penetration of the datacenter market for some time, but it came from an unexpected source. The hyperscale datacenter providers such as Google, Microsoft, AWS, all have the resources to design their own chips, and I expect more will do so. The handwriting is on the wall for commodity chip makers such as Intel ( INTC ) and AMD ( AMD ).\\nJuan Carlos Zuleta: Apart from Facebook\\'s shares fall over data privacy since July, the biggest story in tech this year was the lawsuit battle between Apple and Qualcomm that brought about a victory for Qualcomm after courts in China and Germany ordered to ban imports, sales and offers for sale of various Apple iPhone models in China.\\nJeffrey Himelson: Privacy concerns.\\nHans Hauge: The story behind semiconductors is simple, people underestimated the impact of crypto. The cryptocurrency market moves in waves, and from what we\\'ve seen the last few years, the waves are getting larger over time. Near the end of 2017, Bitcoin mining machines and graphics cards were selling on the secondary markets for multiples of their retail price. As the market crashed, all those cards flooded the market, and we saw the classic bullwhip effect. Suddenly there\\'s inventory piling up, and it will take some time for this to rectify itself. Semiconductors are a great long term play, and if you can get in while the price is discounted, all the better.\\nTom Lloyd: This is just the usual cyclical downturn. It should be no surprise to anyone. Just recognize the truth and don\\'t ride the cycle to the bottom. Micron has to prove this cycle is different. Otherwise investors need to wait for the bottom and the next upcycle.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: Semis especially go in cycles. Q3 was a clear drop making Q2 the peak. That would mean that year-over-year growth probably continues down through Q2\\'19 at least. The problem is this upcycle was a little longer than the typical two years so the risk is the downcycle takes a little longer to work out. This is also not yet a safe group and certainly not before the trade war is resolved. We\\'ve been cautious on semis for a few quarters.\\nDamon Verial: Semiconductor stock strength is contingent on tech stock strength, which itself is contingent on the general economy. I believe semiconductors will bounce back shortly.\\nJoe Albano: It\\'s not a downturn like the market thinks of semi downturns. The last downturn was because end demand for an entire category basically came to a halt (PC DRAM) while supply was still ramping. This time it\\'s not a matter of end demand weakening materially and not a matter of drunken supply. Instead, it\\'s an inter-vendor demand issue. After a huge rise in demand, now a few levers have fallen off (crypto mining for one), and there\\'s excess inventory at the OEM level. That inventory is being worked through to the end user, but it softens demand back to the manufacturer. Until this inventory is worked through, there isn\\'t a need for more bits being shipped. However, once inventory is cleared out, the end demand that was still there - \"hidden\" from the manufacturers - will cause a need to put product in the channel. At that point, after a year of capex cuts (controlled supply), there will be an imbalance the other way and demand will overtake supply. Look for this to happen in Q4 2019, if not slightly earlier.\\nMatt Bohlsen: I think we are most likely to have a short term (1 year) lull as global smartphone sales have currently stalled. As we move past this and with the arrival of (and increase of) 5G, robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, IoTs, cloud data storage expansion; that will lead to the next upcycle in semiconductors probably not felt until 2020. Many consumers are waiting to upgrade to 5G smartphones which we will start to see in 2019. This will increase further in 2020. 5G will be up to 100 x faster than 4G, and will soon have a huge impact.\\nBilly Duberstein: Very important, and even experts disagree on this question. In my opinion, I think the current slowdown is a pause, or \"air pocket\" amid a powerful secular trend, and I\\'m sticking to my guns on this. That being said, if the Fed and/or administration makes a policy error on China or anything else and we get a global recession or depression, I\\'ll be wrong, or it will take longer to play out. I happen to think the semi trends are very powerful (\"smart everything\"), which are battling near-term cyclical concerns - and by the way, these are still just concerns. The economy is still growing. We unfortunately had crypto-mania and tax cuts, leading to a boom, and now trade war and Fed hikes have slammed the brakes. This is not ideal if you are a chip company that\\'s trying to match supply with demand on a near-term basis. I think the long-term picture is still pretty positive for most of these companies.\\nMark Hibben: I think the market has gotten overly frightened about semis. The news media and the market don\\'t make the distinction between old paradigm, commoditized semiconductor companies such as Intel and Micron, and new paradigm semiconductor companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon. Memory and storage probably is headed into a cyclical decline, but that doesn\\'t mean that the new paradigm companies will follow. However, the market is acting like semis are a monolithic block. I believe that when the new paradigm companies report December quarter results, they\\'ll surprise to the upside.\\nTom Lloyd: We are preparing for slowing growth and lower earnings. The Fed, tariffs, gridlock in Congress, impeachment in the White House, combine for a disruptive and toxic brew for the stock market and the economy. We expect those who are Indexing will lose money in 2019 and 2020. So the Indexers need to become stock pickers again and make sure they are only in stocks that are beating the Index. Portfolio managers will rotate to lower beta stocks which will fall less than the market. The Dow stocks seem more attractive than the Nasdaq. We have a daily report on the Dow Index Stocks and only 11 have Sell Signals according to our computer system. I like the Healthcare, Technology and Communications Services ETFs for 2019.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: I think 2019 is going to be super volatile, more than we see today. Everybody\\'s going to need to change how they think about stocks, trading and fundamentals. We\\'ve added a market overlay component to our service in the last few months and it helped our subscribers hedge out the last three months. Why take risk when the market is showing you it\\'s heading down. Volatile markets are bear markets. It looks like we\\'re early on in that. That said, I want to respect the market up or down but we cannot be complacent hoping stocks only go up. Fundamentals slowing in combination with downtrending volatile markets is something to respect and tread lightly.\\nDamon Verial: I believe that we will see the end of our current bull market and the beginning of a bear market in 2019. This is not tech-specific but will affect the entire market as a whole. The economic variables are peaking and growth is slowing. Once we see growth sloping down, which I predict we will see somewhere around the middle of 2019, the market should be around its peak and begin to fall. This will be a normal, \"natural\" bear market and is something all investors - tech investors included - should be preparing for as we enter 2019.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: Crypto (that\\'s my area of expertise here). 2018 was a tough year for it, with the storyline being something akin to the bubble burst. But what happens next? I\\'m hoping 2019, or perhaps 2020, will be where the real projects separate themselves and show the world what this innovative technology can do to industries. I think we\\'ll see heavily invested-in companies be able to do this first (Ripple, Stellar, Vechain), but the big elephant is going to Bitcoin at least through 2019. So depending on how the world economy adjusts to either let Bitcoin in or lock it out will have a huge effect on the crypto market at large.\\nJoe Albano: Recovery. When does large growth return? That\\'s the question.\\nApp Economy Insights: As someone based in the San Francisco Bay Area who covers the App Economy, 2019 couldn\\'t look more exciting. It looks like it will be the year of the \"decacorns\" going public such as Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, possibly Pinterest among others. I look forward to following closely the trends that make the rise of the App Economy and the businesses resulting from it so fascinating, both from a consumer and an investor standpoint: the gig economy, experience economy, games as a service, online dating, transportation and more.\\nB&B Market: Given that I focus on China and Chinese ADRs, 2018 had a lot of drama from the trade relations to currency weakness and more. As a result, we saw China stocks get crushed for the majority of the year and only just start to improve. For 2019, I am looking to capitalize on this. A lot of these companies have had revenues, earnings, margins, you name it, improve over the past few years but they are trading at very low multiples. The trade-war has been the focus and while I do not think it will disappear in 2019, I think most of the fear is already priced in.\\nMatt Bohlsen: My top 5 tech trends for 2019 are 5G, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things [IoTs], and cloud data storage expansion. Many of these themes are just starting to grow now so will take about 3-5 years to really see the full impact.\\nBilly Duberstein: I am leaning towards quality and balance sheet strength. Many high-quality companies have been sold off really hard, so it\\'s a great opportunity to upgrade the quality of your portfolios. Market leadership and a great balance sheet can help mitigate (or take advantage of) near-term volatility, especially in a rising rate environment. Fortunately, there are lots of leading tech companies that are currently in the best financial shape of their lives after the boom times of 2016-2017. Still, I think we will have a somewhat binary outcome in tech, revolving around US-China trade talks. If the U.S. and China make a deal that investors believe in, we could have a huge rally. If we don\\'t, we could languish here. Hard to think it could get worse, but then again, I didn\\'t think we\\'d be at these levels we\\'re at today.\\nMark Hibben: I\\'m mainly hoping that prices stay low for the tech companies I\\'m interested in so I can load up before prices go back up. For the time being, I\\'m content to wait until I see some signs of market stabilization, and because I can\\'t afford to buy any more at the moment. I am becoming concerned that the markets could induce a recession through a self-fulfilling prophesy, but right now, the indicators are just for a slowdown. The overall performance of the U.S. and other world economies in 2019 is going to weigh heavily on investors no matter what.\\nJuan Carlos Zuleta: In 2019 I am preparing for more news on electrification of the global automotive industry with China consolidating its leadership and North America surpassing Europe in the second place, which is altogether likely to exert much more pressure over the energy lithium value chain.\\nHans Hauge: I think Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) will be the best performing asset in 2019. Since 2010, we\\'ve seen the hash rate double 30 times, the number of transactions double 11 times, and the price double 16 times. Each time we see the price hit a new factor of ten (which has happened five times already), there\\'s a pull back and a \"crypto winter.\" During this crypto winter, the technology continues to be upgraded, improved - it evolves. Right now, the exact same thing is happening. Bitcoin\\'s average fee at this activity level was $10-$20 earlier this year, now it\\'s less than $0.40. A majority of the arguments against Bitcoin are based on two things (1) people don\\'t understand what it means, so they just can\\'t process what success would look like or (2) they don\\'t know what drives the value and they just aren\\'t educated on the topic. However, if you really dig in, you\\'ll see why some very smart people have dedicated their careers to the cryptoasset space. Blockchain technology is changing the world, and Bitcoin is the gold standard of the blockchain universe.\\nTom Lloyd: I expect the market to be down in 2019 and 2020. Therefore, I am very interested in stocks that are already beaten down to their bottoms, have very little downside risk and will bounce back. We will add Facebook, Apple, Nvidia and Netflix to our model portfolio as they bounce up from their bottoms. Micron is not one I am interested in bottom fishing. I think Amazon and Google will beat the Index, but I don\\'t think they will be in our model portfolio. We let our computer Buy/Hold/Sell Signals tell us on a daily basis.\\nElazar Advisors, LLC: I have to tell you there are not so many good ideas out there right now. You have to respect slowing fundamentals. If you do, then you don\\'t want to own much of anything. There are a few great ones though and we\\'ve managed to catch big earnings performers in this market downdraft. Twitter is starting to see a big earnings inflection. There was that Citron call that Twitter\\'s going to get hit because of trolls harassing people but Twitter\\'s been on to that already. There was no new news in that call. Twitter\\'s priority throughout \\'18 was \"health\" removing bad actors. The recent report that Citron cited I think changes nothing in Twitter\\'s already proactive process. In the meantime, more importantly, we saw Twitter with a big Q3, and Q4 is seasonally stronger than Q3. They are making gradual changes to their network that are benefiting usage and advertiser ROI (Return On Investment). They might have an opening with Facebook and Google woes as well. Based on blow-out earnings potential, we see the stock can approach the high-50s which is like 100%+ upside potential.\\nDamon Verial: As previously stated, I believe 2019 will see both the peak of the bull market and the beginning of a bear market. Thus, my thesis for 2019 is not single-fold but two-fold. The market should represent an inverse parabola in this year, so my best idea for Q1-2 2019 will be bullish, while my best idea for Q3-4 2019 will be bearish. As Q3-4 is too early to call, I will simply answer that my best pick for this recent correction and the bounce back is Arista Networks ( ANET ), a fundamentally solid company still in a growth phase unfairly devalued by the recent selloff and one on which I have recently discussed in my newsletter.\\nMichael Wiggins De Oliveira: Every single large tech company is laser focused on content: either scripted or unscripted. Netflix accomplished the unthinkable and very quickly. It has added 130 million subscribers to its platforms by focusing in on large quantities of scripted content. Furthermore, Netflix\\'s platform has carved out strong time share in consumers\\' viewing time. It has indeed been so successful that well financed companies are now all trying to play this same game. Accordingly, 2019 will see Apple enter the foray as well as Disney+. Alphabet\\'s YouTube has also spoken about its plans to increase viewers\\' time on YouTube as an educational tool. Additionally, Facebook Watch has also shown determination to aggressively increase the amount of time its users spend watching and interacting with Watch\\'s content. Obviously, we also have Amazon Video playing this game too. However, a meaningfully less discussed company which I believe might succeed in surprising many investors in 2019 is Discovery ( DISCK ), of which I\\'m a shareholder. Discovery\\'s business model is different from that of Apple\\'s, Amazon Video or Netflix, in that Discovery\\'s content is unscripted and very inexpensive to produce. In fact, not only is Discovery\\'s business model is very cost-effective but Discovery has the IP on all of its content. For viewers of specific genre, be it sports, such as golf on the brand new Golf Tv platform, or Olympics through Eurosports, Discovery leads. Also, among women Discovery has a particularly strong market share. And while the self-propelled myth of cord-cutting appears to be engulfing Wall Street, this has left Discovery trading irrationally cheap. For FY 2019 Discovery is roughly guiding for $3 billion of free cash flow. Which means that currently, Discovery is trading for less than 7 times free cash flow. Compare that with Netflix, which will not have free cash flow for many years, and in the best case scenario, by my own estimates not likely to generate more than $2 billion of free cash flow once it tapers off its elevated content investment - leaving it trading at 50 times future free cash flow multiples. While at same time, its top line is already slowing down to below 30% year-over-year.\\nThe Freedonia Cooperative: Anyone following my posts and/or is part of The Coin Agora knows I love Vechain, a logistics blockchain company out of China. Right now, its coin is super discounted (in my opinion) and gives investors a chance to lock up a significant amount of coins before its platform really gets started. In the coming year(s), Vechain will host DNV GL\\'s food shipping blockchain and BYD\\'s electronic car aspect of the carbon credit system-just to name two of many partnerships. It\\'s my favorite bet in crypto and it has nothing to do with disrupting the worldwide financial system-it\\'s just putting logistical data on a blockchain for better record keeping.\\nJoe Albano: The best idea for 2019 is to have cash at the ready. We\\'re in a downtrend in tech and there\\'s no reason to rush in yet. That being said, I like Broadcom ( AVGO ). It\\'s a standout in the tech space - an outlook that is robust and bullish - while the rest of the sector is not on a firm foundation. Raising the dividend 51% was the \"put your money where your mouth is\" moment and management is putting forth all the right signals. I\\'m a buyer on technical support tests.\\nApp Economy Insights: In a market that is likely to be volatile and possibly with depressed valuation and the prospect of the r-word (recession), I am looking forward to strengthening positions in Enterprise Software. Indeed, Enterprise Software is likely to shine in a slowing economy - while consumer goods may suffer, enterprise software will remain relatively constant. Thus, there will be no shortage of demand for the best-in-class tools that empower the data science, finance, sales and marketing or engineering teams to achieve greatness.\\nB&B Market: I focus on Chinese ADRs, that is my specialty. The idea that has been on the forefront of my mind lately is Momo ( MOMO ). The stock reached all-time highs (near-$60) earlier in 2018, but is now back down into the low-$20s. Both top-line and bottom-line are growing at strong double-digit rates, MAUs are increasing every quarter, and the company has recently acquired Tantan, which is also growing in popularity. All of Momo and Tantan are internet platforms that are not impacted directly by tariffs from the trade tensions. However, because of a recent guidance cut (still growing at 40+%), institutional analysts have cut the PT from $60 down to $31. I may have missed the class that states short-term issues warrant a 50% reduction in valuation in the long-term. I am very bullish on this stock and believe that a majority of the Chinese ADRs are undervalued as a result of market overreaction from the trade war.\\nMatt Bohlsen: My best idea is to use the current tech and semiconductor downturn to start to accumulate positions at cheaper prices ready for the next upcycle. For example, I would be accumulating the following:\\nOthers that have broad exposure to the above themes are also worth considering such as Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ), Baidu ( BIDU ), Intel, and Microsoft. Cashed up giants Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft are also good tech names to accumulate at yearly lows.\\nBilly Duberstein: I rode Micron all the way up in the first half of 2018 with terrific gains and then unfortunately rode it all the way back down. It currently trades just over tangible book and the company has $3 billion net cash. The stock just sold off on what *could* be a trough quarter guidance that missed expectations but really doesn\\'t look so bad relative to the current valuation of the company if it is the low point (or close to it) in the cycle. $2 billion net income and ~$1 billion FCF for the next quarter on a $35 billion market cap ain\\'t so bad, especially if it\\'s a trough. Last year the company made $14 billion and ~$10 billion in FCF. The DRAM oligopoly seems to be working to control supply (Micron just announced capex cuts) and the long-term demand outlook for memory should be strong and diverse, even if we are currently in a demand \"air pocket\" (fueled by the boom-bust phenomenon I discussed above). Micron is also structurally a much, much more profitable company than it was just three years ago relative to its Korean competitors, so it should be able to stay profitable in a downturn while also buying back a significant amount of stock at the same time, which it didn\\'t have the means to do in 2016. If the downturn turns out to be milder than feared, this historically low-multiple stock could re-rate higher coming out the other side. You may need to wait a couple quarters and have a strong stomach, but there\\'s multi-bagger potential here, barring a global recession or trade war escalation.\\nMark Hibben: I think Nvidia is by far the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. It\\'s fundamentally a new paradigm semiconductor company being priced as if it were an old paradigm company with no future. Of all the tech companies in my portfolio, I consider Nvidia to have the greatest growth potential in relative terms. Nvidia is pioneering in many fields, including AI, autonomous machines and high performance computing. Nvidia\\'s Turing architecture GPUs are available for professionals and gamers, and provide real time photorealistic rendering that would have been considered impossible a year ago. Nvidia has no competition in this new category of graphics visualization (called ray-tracing), and has ensured continued leadership for many years due to its ray-tracing patents. I doubt that there\\'s market for three major GPU suppliers (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and I believe that AMD will be forced to spin off or sell its Radeon GPU business since it won\\'t be able to compete in ray-tracing. Intel is the most likely buyer.\\nJuan Carlos Zuleta: Tesla is certainly my best bet for 2019 because despite all the problems it faced throughout the year, it demonstrated its shareholders its strength to preserve the value of the company. In this connection, we have to be vigilant as to how and when it proceeds to start assembling EVs in China and launching its long-awaited more affordable Model 3 in the U.S. and elsewhere.\\nJeffrey Himelson: I see Fitbit receiving FDA clearance, entering into numerous new partnerships and generating returning revenue streams, which will propel the stock in 2019.\\n***\\nThanks to our panel for sharing their insights on the fast moving tech sector.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\n Facebook, Inc. FB   had a rough time in 2018, thanks to a host of factors that tarnished the brand\\'s image. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, Russian-disinformation, data breaches and proliferation of fake news were some of the incidents that battered the reputation of the tech giant.  \\n Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) \\n    \\n Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  |  Facebook, Inc. Quote \\n Security Lapses Remain the Biggest Concern    The security issues are not only spooking users but also advertisers. Since advertising accounts for more than 98% of Facebook\\'s revenues, this is likely to impact top-line growth. In fact, management projects revenue growth rate to decelerate in mid-to-high single digit percentage in the fourth quarter.    Moreover, the company projects total expenses in 2019 to surge 40-50% from 2018 driven by Facebook\\'s significant investments to strengthen platform security.    Facebook has taken several measures to curb misuse of its platform throughout 2018. Recently, the social media giant removed  several accounts and pages that spread misinformation and engaged in \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" ahead of Bangladesh election.    Facebook also put together a team of specialists to monitor  the upcoming Lok Sabha election in India. Moreover, the company is working closely  with the Election Commission of India to limit the dissemination of fake news and external interference on the platform.    Prior to this, Facebook had undertaken similar security measures  ahead of election in Brazil, the United States and UK.    Additionally, Facebook is improving transparency and security for its ads  and pages  . It recently announced a pilot program to help secure U.S. candidates and campaign staff from \"hackers and foreign adversaries.\"    Further, the social media giant announced that the company will restrain from physically sending its employees to promote the use of the platform for political campaigns.    Facebook\\'s efforts to plug security loopholes as well as limit fake news globally are expected to eventually boost trustworthiness.   WhatsApp and Instagram: Key Catalysts    Instagram and WhatsApp have emerged as Facebook\\'s cash cows. Instagram boasts more than 1 billion monthly users and 500 million daily users, while the latter has an estimated user base of over 1.3 billion.    The company continues to add features on Instagram to entice users and advertisers. Notably, Stories on Instagram has surpassed 400 million daily actives.    Moreover, the company is looking for ways to monetize Instagram Stories and adding e-commerce features to the platform. Facebook\\'s endeavor to incorporate AR technology into Instagram\\'s shopping app can act as a differentiator in terms of providing better customer experience.    To monetize WhatsApp, Facebook is bringing \"conversational commerce\" to the platform. WhatsApp status now has 450 million daily active users (DAUs) globally. The company is also planning to roll out ads on WhatsApp status.    We believe that Instagram and WhatsApp\\'s robust future prospects are expected to help in the tech giant\\'s revival in 2019.   Facebook Ventures into Video Streaming    Facebook intends to cash in on the ever-increasing trend of video viewing on social media platforms. The social media giant has a budget of $1 billion for its video initiatives.    Through Watch, the company is trying to incorporate more video-oriented content, including original shows and live streaming of sports events like Major League Baseball (MLB). Exclusive streaming rights for Copa Libertadores & UEFA Champions League matches in South America as well as Spain\\'s La Liga matches in the Indian sub-continent are expected to boost user base in 2019.    Facebook unveiled In-Stream Reserve program and ThruPlay on its platform for companies to advertise on the most popular videos on its platform. As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars and boost its top line in the near term.    Facebook is also investing heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to lure users. The company recently launched Portal, an AI powered voice-controlled device with features like smart camera, speaker, digital assistant and video calling.    Portal\\'s features are expected to boost Facebook\\'s position in the smart speaker market, currently dominated by the likes of Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple\\'s HomePod.   Will a Change at the Top Aid Facebook?    Per reports, Facebook\\'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg\\'s net worth of $75 billion in the beginning of the year scaled down to $60 billion by the end of 2018. Moreover, year to date, the stock has lost 29.7% compared with the S&P 500 composite\\'s decline of 12%.\\n  \\nFacebook\\'s top investors including state and city treasurers are yearning for a change at the top. Shareholders have given a proposal to the company\\'s board to separate the CEO and chairman positions and want Mark Zuckerberg to step down.    The shareholders have made at least six attempts since 2012 to remove him as chairman but have failed owing to the dual class structure of the company, which allows Zuckerberg to control 60% of shareholder voting power    Apple\\'s AAPL  CEO Tim Cook too criticized Facebook\\'s business model of monetizing customers\\' personal information and said that the time to regulate the platform has passed away.    However, Facebook\\'s current endeavors to regain user confidence are hard to ignore. Moreover, the company\\'s huge user base provides it a significant competitive edge. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).   Key Picks    Etsy ETSY  and Internet Initiative Japan IIJI  are better-ranked stocks in the same sector. Both the stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today\\'s Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nIt\\'s a rare stock that can outperform the market by almost 40   percentage points in a year but still seem like a disappointment   to many investors.   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) shares fit that description, having more than   doubled through the first half of 2018 before careening down to   smaller -- but still market-thumping -- gains in the year\\'s final   weeks.\\nSo what\\'s the future look like for the streaming video titan,   whose cast of direct competitors will include   Disney    \\xa0by the end of 2019? Let\\'s peer into our crystal ball.\\n  \\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nYou wouldn\\'t know it just by looking at the stock price   movement since October, but Netflix\\'s business is on a tear right   now. The entertainment giant   added 7 million subscribers    in the third quarter to blow past the guidance that CEO Reed   Hastings and his team issued three months earlier. Rising monthly   fees helped push profitability higher in both its U.S. and   international segments, too.\\nBased on the company\\'s latest forecast, Netflix should end the   year with a bang, adding 9.4 million users in results set to   publish on Jan. 17, compared to the prior year\\'s 8.3 million.   That result would put total additions at 29 million for 2018 to   mark the company\\'s fifth straight year of accelerating user   gains. Netflix   added 24 million users    during its blockbuster 2017 fiscal year.\\nSure, the company could come up short of that fourth-quarter   target. But given the strength of its content lineup, and   traditionally strong holiday seasonal period, I\\'d say it\\'s a bit   more likely that Hastings and his team overshoot their latest   guidance.\\nNetflix should update its spending plans for the upcoming year   in an announcement that will carry plenty of ammunition for both   bulls and bears. Its content investments should jump above the $8   billion it projected for 2018, and that total amounts to a   significant competitive barrier. After all, few companies could   hope to approach that financial commitment -- especially without   the support of almost 150 million paying users providing steady   cash inflows.\\nHowever, its growing user base and the tilt toward exclusive   content means that Netflix needs to pay more cash to keep its   pipeline full, and so investors should see rising cash outflows   and increasing debt levels ahead even though earnings are   rising.\\nThe cash burn isn\\'t concerning management even after landing   at around $3 billion in 2018. \"We have the same high confidence   in the underlying economics,\" executives said in October, \"as our   cash investments in the past.\" The main difference these days is   that the bets are getting bigger.\\nIt\\'s been a decade since Netflix launched its streaming   service and just five years since the company began its original   content strategy. In early 2013, executives predicted they were   ushering in a \"defining moment in the development of Internet TV\"   when they made the first season of   House of Cards    -- all of it -- available for streaming. The exclusive content   initiative has been a smashing success and is now on pace to   approach $2 billion    \\xa0in annual spending.\\nThat content move joins on-demand viewing and binge watching   as just a few of the ways Netflix has changed how people consume   TV entertainment. There will be more disruptions to come.\\nNetflix\\'s movie budget is big enough that it can consider   itself a viable platform for films to start bypassing theaters,   for example. The recent rollout of   Christmas Chronicles    , starring Kurt Russell, attracted 20 million views during its   first week, management said. That would amount to a smashing $200   million opening if it applied to movie ticket sales.\\nBut blockbuster straight-to-streaming movies are just one of   the avenues that Netflix is eyeing for disruption in 2019 and   beyond. Hastings and his team are right to take an aggressive   stance toward these opportunities, at least as long as   subscribers keep announcing their approval by boosting their   engagement hours to record highs.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nAs 2018 winds to a close, it's provided an excellent reminder   to the investing world that nothing goes up in a straight line.   This quarter has brought with it the   steepest correction in a decade    and, at one point, the worst December decline in 80 years.\\nThen again, it's not as if investors are exactly suffering --   especially those who bought and held the FAANG stocks since their   bottom in March 2009.   Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) ,   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) ,   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) ,   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) , and Google, now a subsidiary of   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , have accounted for a significant   portion of the   Nasdaq Composite    's and   S&P 500    's returns over the past decade.\\nAs we look toward 2019, a reasonable case could be made for   purchasing all five of these beloved tech and consumer giants.   Yet, upon deeper digging, it becomes apparent that one deserves   to be left on the sidelines.\\n  \\nImage source: Facebook.\\nI'll be the first to admit that the FAANG stocks have plenty   to offer in terms of high growth and potentially sustainable   competitive advantages. Here's a brief synopsis of why each of   these five companies could be set into a portfolio and   potentially forgotten about for years.\\n  \\nImage source: Amazon.\\nAs I said, a case can be made that all five of these companies   are worth buying. But heading into 2019, Wall Street and   investors are considerably more focused on valuations than   they've been in a long time. Thankfully, in many instances, these   FAANG stocks   are looking cheaper than they've been in a   while    .\\nHowever, analyzing FAANG stocks in a traditional way -- i.e.,   by examining trailing and forward P/E ratios -- typically doesn't   work well. Rather, these high-growth stocks are best viewed in   the context of their cash flow. The ability to generate positive   cash flow from their businesses is especially important, because   these are companies that really like to reinvest in future growth   opportunities.\\nTake Facebook as an example. The social media giant is   projected by Wall Street to generate $12.47 in cash flow per   share (CFPS) by 2020. Over the past five years, Facebook has been   valued at an average of 31.4 times its cash flow. Should this   2020 estimate prove accurate, Facebook is now valued at just   under 11 times its future cash flow.\\nThe same story is true for Amazon, which has been valued at an   average of 30.4 times its cash flow over the past five years. By   2021, as AWS increases in size and the company's margins expand,   its cash flow per share could hit $143. That's a future   price-to-CFPS ratio of just over 10.\\nWe see similar attractive valuations from Apple and Alphabet.   Wall Street's estimated $17.09 in cash flow per share for Apple   in 2020 places the tech giant at about nine times future cash   flow, which is a bit below its five-year average of 11. As for   Alphabet, its five-year average has been 18.1, with the company   on track for $71.66 in cash flow per share by 2020. That'd work   out to a future price-to-CFPS of less than 15.\\n  \\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nThe outlier is Netflix. Netflix has made no apologies for   spending liberally on content, both proprietary and licensed, in   order to bolster its domestic subscriber base, as well as lay the   foundation for streaming content in international markets.   Essentially, it's a spend-at-any-cost strategy to gain as many   subscribers as possible.\\nBut there's a downside to this business model. Namely, it   burns through capital. Now, this isn't to say Netflix isn't well   capitalized, because it is. But Netflix has been burning through   its cash on hand for many years now -- and this is a trend that   won't change in 2019. In fact, after losing $4 in cash flow per   share in 2017, Netflix projects to lose $6.39 per share in 2018   and $5.48 per share in 2019. No one is certain when Netflix will   actually begin generating positive cash flow from its   business.\\nIn a healthy market where fear is minimal, this is a statistic   which could be easily overlooked. After all, Netflix is growing   its subscriber base with regularity, and it maintains clear   competitive advantages in the streaming space. But in a market   where investors are clearly panicking, Netflix's net cash outflow   is going to stick out like a sore thumb.\\nMy suggestion: Avoid Netflix in 2019.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

We've talked about that. You know the game we're playing here.   I say let's get right into it with stock No. 1.\\nThese are alphabetical, just as I did on the podcast, and as I   did with our previous stock sampler. What was up first   alphabetically? We like to do it by company name. Let's kick it   off with, yep, Amazon. I picked it with that five-stock sampler   two years ago. It was at $770 a share. Today, as I mentioned   already, it's at $1,604. Good news, that stock put under the   tree, that made a wonderful gift, the gift that keeps on giving,   up 108%.\\nHow's it doing against the stock market? Well, the stock   market over the last two years since that 12/7/16 podcast, the   stock market is up 16%. With Amazon up 108, -16, that's a plus 92   in the win column. Let's go to stock No. 2.\\nStock No. 2, one of those companies that puts a lot of   products underneath people's trees this time of year. That's   Apple. Apple two years ago was at $111 a share. Today, it's at   $167. By the way, I should mention, since it's kind of a theme   this podcast, Apple was at $230 in October. It's gone from $230   down to $167. I'm really happy to say, we're still up 50%. Vs.   16% for the market, that's a plus 34 in the win column for Apple.   92 plus 34, we're up 126% over the market so far.\\nSpoiler alert: it's about to get better.\\nStock No. 3: Activision Blizzard, the video game and   entertainment company. Another one of those companies whose gifts   I appreciate receiving this time of year. Activision Blizzard two   years ago was at $37.50. Today, it's at $48. That's a 28% gain.   That gives us a plus 12 in the win column. That brings us up to   plus 126.\\nDo I sound like a broken record? My golly, this stock was at   $85 in October. It's dropped from $85 to $48 in two months. And   yet, we're still pretty happy with our longer-term returns,   beating the market.\\nI know a lot of people say the market is going to get hit at   some point, or 2019 is going to be a bad year after all these   great years. Have we been looking at the last couple of months? I   did say a few months ago on this podcast, I think we're already   in a bear market. And a lot of times, the pain really happens   upfront. When I'm seeing companies like   Nvidia    cut in half in two months, and Activision Blizzard nearly cut it   in half in two months, and Amazon and Apple 20%, 30% down from   their recent highs, I feel like we've already felt a lot of the   pain. Things might get surprisingly better from here. We'll see   in 2019. I think the market's going up!\\nAlright, stock No. 4 is maybe a particularly interesting one,   because this company, it is often said, has had about as bad a   year as any big company could have. Stock No. 4 that we put under   the tree two years ago this month was Facebook. Facebook was at   $118 a share that day. Today, it tips the scales at $146. It's up   24%. We're four for four on the stocks we're putting under the   tree. It's not been a great investment. Up 24%, that's 8% ahead   of the market.\\nFacebook in July was at $218. We're printing our results here   when it's at $146. This is another company that has lost a huge   amount of value. And yet, I don't even think as much as you'd   expect from the headlines that we read. Some people, it seems to   me, are leaving Facebook nearly for dead at this point, thinking   their problems run so deep, everything from questionable   executive decisions right through to betraying the trust of their   customers, or security leaks, bad decisions, bad outcomes, and   results. It certainly hasn't been a good time. I know a lot of   you are probably not very happy with Facebook right now. As an   investor, I'm not very happy with Facebook dropping from $218 to   $146 in just a few months. That said, doesn't it sound like a lot   of the other companies we're talking about? I don't think   Facebook really deserves to be singled out in quite the way that   headlines are naturally doing. I'm not excusing any of the bad   behavior and bad performance at Facebook. I sure would like to   see things get better. And yet, my horse sense, the Fool in me,   thinks that things are probably going to get better than people   think.\\nWe'll take our little plus eight and we'll add that in the win   column. That takes us from 138 to 146.\\nWhat was the fifth and final stock we put under the tree two   years ago? By the way, what a two years it has been for these   stocks! I mean, the market's been good, a 16% gain over two   years. Not bad. It's about the historical average. But I'm really   happy to say Netflix, stock No. 5, has had a really good two   years. This is another one, if you put this stock under the tree   -- for example, if you bought shares for a child instead of   giving them another gadget, or another hunk of plastic, I mean, I   like those things, too. I sure did when I was a kid. But, you can   also give stock. And it's not just to kids. You can give it to   brothers, uncles. Of course, it's easier to give stocks to   somebody who has a brokerage account already. But, if you're   thinking about somebody who hasn't started investing yet, here's   what you can do. You can give them money. Just give them cold   cash and they can then open an account and buy stocks with your   monetary gift. I think stock makes a wonderful gift. As we're   discovering in this podcast, it's hard for me to think of more   rewarding gifts, frankly, as I think about the hardware under   many trees, than what we're describing and discussing in this   podcast.\\nNetflix, two years ago, $126 a share. Today, $272. The stock   is up 116%. Subtracting 16, that's an even plus 100 for this   fifth stock, we put it under the tree. You total it all up, we're   at plus 246 for this group. That's right, take these five stocks   together, add up their percentage points by which they have   beaten the market, and that's a plus 246.\\nBy the way, to finish out the math, the average gain of these   five companies was plus 65% against the stock market, which over   the last two years was up 16%. So, 49% per stock ahead of the   market averages for one of my better five-stock samplers. This is   one of those rare ones where I got all five of them right so far.   But, I do want to put an asterisk. I don't want to gloat or   celebrate here. This is only two years later. If 2019 is a bad   year, maybe these stocks decline further. We'll see whether you   wanted them under the tree in retrospect. But right now, I'm   going to predict you were really happy to either give or receive   these stocks. And remember, the greatest gift is the gift of   giving. I hope you'll think about giving some of your favorite   companies, some of your favorite stocks if you're a stock market   investor, so many of you are, think about giving a stock to   somebody else.\\n John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon     subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of     directors.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nAt one point in time, there was robust enthusiasm surrounding Chinese internet streaming giant iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ ). Given its roots in the streaming market and huge revenue growth rates, many market observers were calling iQiyi the \" Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) of China\". On that positive comparison, IQ stock soared from an $18 IPO price in March, to nearly $50 by June.\\nThen, reality hit.\\nNamely, the same things that stung Netflix stock a few years back, hit iQiyi stock a few months back. Despite huge and sustained revenue growth, margins are a huge question mark, and those questions are only getting bigger with ballooning content costs.\\nNetflix was able to break through the profitability wall because of subscriber base scale and subscription price hikes. Neither of those look like a sure thing for iQiyi at this point in time. As such, IQ stock has sunk 70% over the past six months.\\nShares project to remain weaker for longer. Until investors have reason to be optimistic about profitability, they won\\'t bid up IQ stock. That won\\'t happen any time soon. As such, IQ stock won\\'t stage any big turnaround rally in the foreseeable future.\\nDespite the recent plunge in IQ stock, there\\'s still a lot to like about this stock from a long term investment perspective.\\niQiyi is, for all intents and purposes, the Netflix of China. The company has over 80 million subscribers who stream movies and TV shows through their platform. The only other streaming video platforms that compare are Tencent Video, which sports just over 60 million subscribers, and Youku.\\nRegardless of the exact figure, iQiyi is part of the Big 3 in China\\'s streaming market. This market projects to be huge.\\xa0There are\\xa0 4.2 billion \\xa0internet users in the world. Nearly\\xa0 800 million \\xa0of them are from China alone. From America\\'s 320 million internet users, there are\\xa0 125 million streaming-video-on-demand subscriptions, implying about 40% penetration. Applying that same rate to China, China\\'s streaming market could measure in excess of 300 million subscriptions in a few years. That figure stands at just over 200 million today.\\nMeanwhile, iQiyi has 80 million subscribers. That number grew by nearly 90% year-over-year last quarter. Given China\\'s huge internet population and low SVOD penetration rate, it looks likely that iQiyi will sustain this huge growth for a lot longer. Indeed, the last time Netflix saw subscriber growth north of 50% was back in late 2010. Eight years later, Netflix is still growing subscribers at a 25% rate. Thus, small penetration with a big growth rate implies a long runway ahead for subscriber growth at iQiyi.\\nIf you assume the Netflix trajectory for iQiyi of big subscriber growth, price hikes, and eventual profitability, then there\\'s plenty to like about IQ stock long term. Indeed, this stock could end up being a multi-bagger, much like Netflix.\\nThe long-term bull thesis in IQ stock, while compelling, lacks clarity at the current moment due to the lack of a tangible and visible pathway to profitability.\\n\\nNetflix struggled with this early on, too. Content costs aren\\'t small. But, you need more content to get more subscribers. Thus, content costs pile up before subscriber revenue piles up, so streaming giants tend to run big losses for a long time before they reach profitability. Netflix burst through that wall because it got enough subscriber revenue to offset content costs. Interestingly enough, Netflix\\'s margins didn\\'t start to improve meaningfully and benefit from opex leverage until revenues hit about $8 billion in 2017.\\niQiyi\\'s revenues over the past twelve months measure under $4 billion.\\xa0Thus, iQiyi has a long ways to go before it can theoretically leverage operating expenses in a way that will drive huge profitability gains.\\niQiyi could get there. But, because China SVOD subscription prices are so low (the standard price for streaming service subscriptions globally is around $10 per month, whereas it is just $3 per month in China), iQiyi will need a ton of subscriber growth to get to that $8 billion mark. That\\'s possible. But, also risky.\\nAs such, investors aren\\'t willing to put a bid a under IQ stock yet because profitability remains a question mark. So long as this remains a question mark, IQ stock will remain weak.\\nThe long-term growth potential of IQ stock as a multi-bagger in the rapidly growing China streaming economy is compelling. But, the market won\\'t focus on this potential until the company adds clarity to its profit situation. Until that happens, IQ stock will remain weaker for longer.\\nAs of this writing, Luke Lango was long NFLX.\\xa0\\nThe post Profitability Remains a Huge Issue for IQ Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nJust when it looked like digital advertising giant Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) was bucking the trend of negative headlines and Facebook stock was finding some upward momentum, yet another few shoes dropped in the company\\'s multi-month data-privacy scandal.\\nNamely, the District of Columbia sued FB over the way the company handled the Cambridge Analytic a data breach. That happened\\xa0 on the same day that the New York Times ran a scathing article on Facebook which detailed how the company had given large tech companies access to users\\' personal data.\\nNone of that is good news. Consequently, the mini-rally of Facebook stock ended abruptly. Facebook stock plunged to levels not seen since January 2017, although the shares have jumped today.\\nIt is easy to look at Facebook stock, call the whole situation \"doom and gloom\" and sell the shares. That\\'s the easy thing to do. That\\'s exactly what the Street has been doing for the past six months and continues to do today. Regardless of how cheap the stock gets or how far it falls, each new negative headline regarding data privacy breaches makes investors want to sell Facebook stock more.\\nThus, until these negative headlines stop rolling in, it\\'s nearly impossible to say with conviction that Facebook stock has bottomed. But it\\'s easy to say this with conviction: the selloff of Facebook stock that occurred in the second half of 2018 is way overdone.\\nAt the end of the day, only three groups matter for Facebook: users, advertisers, and regulators. Users and advertisers aren\\'t quitting the FB ecosystem. Regulators can\\'t do much to hurt Facebook\\'s business.\\nOver the long-term, the bulls will be right about Facebook stock. No one really knows when this sinking ship will turn around. But it will inevitably turn around at some point. When it does, Facebook stock will stage a huge rally.\\nThe most important factor that determines Facebook\\'s long-term value is the number of users on Facebook\\'s ecosystem. As long as the Facebook ecosystem has billions of digital users, Facebook stock will have a bright future.\\nAt this point in time, there is little evidence indicating that Facebook\\'s recent negative press has had an adverse impact on its user base. Facebook\\'s daily active user base is still growing, and while it\\'s plateauing in North America and Europe, that plateauing growth problem predates the data privacy problems and is more a function of saturation than anything else.\\nAlso, Instagram remains the hottest social media app in the world, while Messenger and WhatsApp are the two most-used messaging apps in the world. Indeed, among the apps available on\\xa0 Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) and Apple\\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) app store, Facebook\\'s four digital properties (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) are still among the four most-downloaded social media and communication apps.\\nOverall, despite the negative press, users aren\\'t abandoning the Facebook ecosystem. Why? Because consumers are addicted to the internet, and Facebook\\'s digital properties, alongside some properties from Google and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), are the most engaging and fun ways to spend time on the internet.\\nThe second-most important (and arguably the most important) factor that determines the long-term value of Facebook stock is the number of marketers who want to advertise on the website. As long as FB has millions of advertisers pumping billions of dollars into the Facebook ecosystem, Facebook will be an extremely valuable company with a bright future.\\nAs on the user front, there is little evidence at this point to suggest that negative press is causing an advertiser exodus. Following the scathing New York Times report, digital marketing publication MarketingLand spoke to three major marketing agencies about ad trends on Facebook. The main takeaway was that performance trumps negative press. Facebook\\'s ads are still performing at industry- leading levels. Thus, negative press has had zero effect on Facebook\\'s ad revenue.\\n\\nAccording to Marty Weintraub, the founder of digital agency Aimclear , his clients care more about \"performance marketing results than political and legal kerfuffle.\" Moreover, the number of ads that Weintraub\\'s clients are buying on Facebook has actually increased recently, he reported.\\nMichelle Morgan, Clix Marketing\\'s director of client services, reiterated that ad performance is the most important criteria for marketers. Because the performance of Facebook\\'s ads has held steady, so have advertisers, she stated. Finally,\\xa0Justin Freid of CMI Media reported that brands continue to have a positive outlook on the advertising platform, adding that it doesn\\'t look like things will go south on that front anytime soon.\\nOverall, despite the negative press, advertisers aren\\'t pulling out of the Facebook ecosystem because brands don\\'t care about politics and data privacy. They care about performance and engagement, and Facebook is still performing well in both areas.\\nThe biggest real concern for owners of Facebook stock is regulation. Specifically, the Street is clearly concerned that Facebook is going to get slapped with several multi-billion dollar fines. The Street is also concerned about FB potentially having to pay higher taxes, and the possibility of legislators restricting Facebook\\'s data usage, thereby limiting the performance of the platform\\'s targeted ads.\\nThe fines are one-time events. Google has been hit with fines before, and its business has easily survived them. The taxes won\\'t be that high, and they are already fully priced into Facebook stock. Taxes also won\\'t threaten the viability of Facebook\\'s business model or the longer-term outlook of Facebook stock.\\nThe big risk is legislation which could hamper the performance of Facebook\\'s targeted ads. But such legislation would hurt the whole digital-ad space. If Facebook can\\'t use certain personal data for ads, neither can Google, Snap (NYSE: SNAP ), or Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ). Thus, everyone will be on the same playing field, and Facebook will still be a better advertising platform than its digital peers. The whole digital-ad playing field will just be less profitable than it is today.\\nBut that isn\\'t a problem. Targeted digital advertising is the future because digital is where consumers\\' eyeballs are and targeting delivers strong results. Thus, there is nowhere else for brands to put their ad dollars besides targeted digital advertising, so regulators can\\'t really do much to derail Facebook\\'s business model.\\nFacebook\\'s press is bad and only getting worse.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nYet another data breach, incriminating internal email communications, share buybacks and analyst opinions were among the most important news on Facebook FB  in the recent past. Here are the details-\\n More User Data Exposed \\nIn what is a rather quick sequel to the big expose of data belonging to 30 million Facebook users, the social media company said that a software glitch inadvertently exposed unshared photos of around 6.8 million users for about 12 days ending Sep 25.\\nThe problem apparently happened when users granted photo access permission to third party apps, which normally allows access to timeline photos only. But in this case, other photos, including some that may have been embarrassing to users were shared with around 1,500 apps built by 876 developers.\\nTomer Bar, an engineering director at Facebook, apologized in an official blog post: \"We\\'re sorry this happened…Early next week we will be rolling out tools for app developers that will allow them to determine which people using their app might be impacted by this bug. We will be working with those developers to delete the photos from impacted users.\"\\nThe problem may have been fixed thereafter, but Facebook\\'s problems appear to have only started. While the company avoided mentioning how many of these users were from Europe, the matter has already been reported to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Facebook\\'s main privacy regulator in the region.\\nWhat\\'s more, the regulator has said that it is already investigating the matter, as well as the data breach in October. \"With reference to these data breaches, including the breach in question, we have this week commenced a statutory inquiry examining Facebook\\'s compliance\" with Europe\\'s GDPR, said DPC spokesman Graham Doyle. The inquiry could cost Facebook $1.6 billion\\xa0(£1.3bn) in fines.\\n Internal Emails Show Bad Intentions \\nA committee of UK lawmakers has published a host of internal emails from 2012 to 2015 between company leaders, including Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg that shows the company\\'s lax attitude toward user data. Not only did the company treat user data as its personal property, but it also chose to share that data with business allies like Netflix NFLX  and Airbnb while keeping it from competing apps like Twitter TWTR  .\\nThe documents, which were under seal in a California court case, were obtained by compelling the founder of U.S. company Six4Three to hand them over during a business trip to London.\\nU.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal didn\\'t mince his words when referring to the \"mounting evidence that Facebook acted chaotically, recklessly and lawlessly by granting access to private consumer data for financial gain.\"\\nDamian Collins, a Conservative British parliamentarian who leads a committee on media and culture, tweeted that \"they [the documents] raise important questions about how Facebook treats users\\' data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market.\"\\nZuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post: \"Ultimately, we decided on a model where we continued to provide the developer platform for free and developers could choose to buy ads if they wanted…Other ideas we considered but decided against included charging developers for usage of our platform, similar to how developers pay to use Amazon AWS or Google Cloud. To be clear, that\\'s different from selling people\\'s data.\"\\nThe company denies wrong doing and maintains that the emails were taken out of context to suit a certain purpose when the company\\'s changes were in fact meant to \"shut down abusive apps.\"\\n Russian Help For Trump \\nA special report put together by Oxford University\\'s Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis company Graphika for the Senate Intelligence Committee discusses a study of millions of social-media posts across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Alphabet\\'s GOOGL  Google+, Pinterest and Tumblr over a number of years.\\nThe report found that a Russian disinformation campaign ran in full swing before the elections, encouraging conservatives to support Trump\\'s campaign while \"The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.\" It warned that social media networks had degenerated into \"a computational tool for social control, manipulated by canny political consultants and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike.\"\\nThe news was revealed by the Washington Post. \\xa0\\n Australia Investigates Market Dominance \\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is looking to establish a regulatory framework that would bring dominant technology platforms Facebook and Google under greater scrutiny, especially with respect to the advertising and digital news distribution markets.\\nIn a preliminary report, the regulatory authority has said that on the one hand, \"consumers face a potential risk of filter bubbles, or echo chambers, and less reliable news on digital platforms\" while on the other, advertisers run the risk of being sidelined when competing with the companies\\' own products (like Google Shopping) because algorithms are a closely guarded business secret.\\nThe report has therefore outlined 11 recommendations and eight areas for further analysis that will yield a final report sometime in June. It seeks to grant investigative and monitoring powers to the existing or new watchdog to determine how these companies rank and display ads and news. \\xa0\\xa0\\nFacebook said it remains \"committed to working with the commission as they review the contribution of all digital platforms in Australia.\"\\nGoogle said \"we develop innovative products to the benefit of consumers, businesses and the economy, and we work closely with advertisers and publishers across Australia.\"\\n Ad Transparency Measures In India \\nFacebook now requires Indian advertisers running political ads on its platforms to first confirm their identity and location as the world\\'s largest parliamentary democracy heads toward elections next year. The measures are similar to those implemented in the U.S. and UK with varying degrees of success, as wrong doers managed to find loopholes in some cases.\\nFacebook\\'s intention is to prevent foreign interference in the elections, so its earlier involvement with Cambridge Analytica (that contracted with the Congress party to do just that) has made everyone wary. Vetting an advertiser can take weeks, so maybe its efforts will not be in vain.\\n Share Buybacks \\nThe board of directors has approved a plan to buy back an additional $9 billion worth of  Facebook shares  . Last year, it approved a plan worth $15 billion. Share buybacks have allowed companies to return value to shareholders after the government lowered taxes.\\nIn Facebook\\'s case, the tool may be that much more useful as the company has lost 24.5% year to date (33.9% in the last six months) as it has been embroiled in scandal after scandal, large scale data breaches and slower growth with the CEO losing favor with lawmakers around the world.\\n Analyst Opinion \\nStifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt downgraded Facebook shares from \"Buy\" to \"Hold\" fearing \"too many adversaries\" in politicians, consumers and employees. \"The political and regulatory blowback seems like it may lead to restrictions on how Facebook operates, over time,\" he says and adds, \"Most importantly, consumers and some employees seem to have grown disenchanted with the company.\"\\nHe mentioned results from an on-going survey of Facebook users showing that 79% believe Facebook\\'s impact on society is neutral or negative, up from 73% in January. Also of concern was the fact that 60% said they rarely or never used key new products like Facebook Stories, Marketplace and video.\\nDeutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley begs to differ. The analyst considers Facebook the top pick among large Internet stocks, with an \"extremely attractive\" valuation. \"We continue to view Facebook as the best risk/reward in large cap Internet given the potential for core Facebook engagement to stabilize, for monetization in the Stories format to drive a potential re-acceleration in growth in mid-2019, for the negative news cycle to abate and given the extremely attractive current valuation,\" he says. He reiterated the Buy rating and made no change to estimates.\\n Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? \\nZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.\\nIgnited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

At its session low, the S&P hit a fresh 20-month low and came within two points of entering bear market territory, measured by a drop of more than 20 percent from a closing high.\\nAmazon.com Inc  jumped 4.02 percent after reporting a \"record-breaking\" season. The stock was giving the biggest boost to the S&P and Nasdaq and led the consumer discretionary index  up 1.49 percent.\\nBut investors anxieties were far from gone. President Donald Trump renewed his attack on the Federal Reserve on Christmas, blaming it for the market slump.\\nTrump also said the U.S. government shutdown, now in its fifth day, would last until his demand for funds to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border is met. \\nA little over 2,100 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq hit 52-week lows.

Don\\'t worry, no dropping   through a chimney required. Just the gift-giving - and, OK, maybe   the cookies, too.\\nThat\\'s right: Now it\\'s time to buy a few gifts to give to   yourself. Done the right way, treating yourself can be enjoyable   and within your   budget    . Here\\'s why it\\'s a good time to look out for No. 1.\\nWas your heart set on something that didn\\'t appear under the   tree? Now\\'s your opportunity to get your hands on exactly what   you had in mind. And since the post-Christmas period features   deals on a variety of products, you\\'re likely to find what you   want at a discounted price.\\nThe price-tracking app Paribus historically has seen price   drops in categories such as home decor, gaming systems, cell   phones and clothing in the two weeks after Christmas.\\n\"Sometimes, we\\'ll see that retailers are trying to get certain   products off the shelf as the Christmas season comes to a close,\"   says Jenna Kaye-Kauderer, head of Paribus.\\nThat\\'s the case with holiday decorations, wrapping paper and   winter clothing, for example.\\nThere\\'s no need to go crazy and buy everything that\\'s on sale   at the end of December and beginning of January. But if you\\'re   eyeing a new pair of knee-high boots, or another item that\\'s been   discounted, consider spending some of the Christmas money or gift   cards you may have received.\\nCould shopping for yourself - and scoring deals - make you   happy during the winter season? It\\'s possible.\\nScott Rick, an associate professor of marketing at the   University of Michigan\\'s Ross School of Business, has researched   consumer spending habits. He says people experience different   levels of distress when spending money and buying gifts.\\n\"Tightwads,\" for example, kick themselves for not buying   things they actually wanted to buy, he says. \"Spendthrifts\" are   the opposite. They overspend, but still end up unhappy.\\nRick says there\\'s a happy medium between these two. \"There\\'s   this middle ground of what we call unconflicted consumers, who   have some distress when they spend money … just enough to keep   them sort of in line,\" Rick says.\\n\"They don\\'t completely deprive themselves,\" he says. \"They   don\\'t go nuts. They are happier, on average, than most tightwads   and spendthrifts.\"\\nSo forget post-holiday blues. The freedom of buying some gifts   for yourself, within reason, could actually be beneficial.\\nAllowing room for self-spending is also part of a healthy   budget.\\n\"You don\\'t want to sacrifice your whole life until retirement   just eating ramen noodles or never buying something for   yourself,\" says Robert P. Finley, a certified financial planner   and the principal of Virtue Asset Management in Illinois.\\nFinley says it\\'s important to consider your emotional and   mental well-being.\\n\"I think it\\'s more than acceptable to buy yourself presents,   especially around the holidays, or even not the holidays, as long   as you\\'re not running up your credit cards to a very high amount   and taking on a lot of debt just to try to make yourself feel   better,\" he says.\\nAs long as you keep your spending within realistic boundaries,   you shouldn\\'t have to feel overly restricted.\\nThe 50/30/20 budget is a helpful guideline. According to this   model, you can spend up to 50 percent of your take-home income on   needs, 30 percent on wants and 20 percent on savings and debt   repayment. Gifts for yourself would fall within the 30 percent   portion - as long as you\\'re not way off in the other   categories.\\nSo go ahead and buy that sherpa blanket that wasn\\'t under the   tree.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nShares of Amazon AMZN  popped 5% in morning trading the day after Christmas after the e-commerce powerhouse said that its customers made more purchases worldwide than ever before during the holiday season. The question now is should investors consider buying Amazon stock on the dip as we move into 2019?\\n Holiday Shopping \\nAmazon posted record-breaking sales during the vital holiday shopping period, according to a company statement Wednesday. The company sold millions of more Amazon devices, which include the new Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick 4K, compared to 2017.\\nOverall, Amazon shipped more than one billion items for free as part of its Prime membership offerings in the U.S. alone. Jeff Bezos\\' firm also saw \"tens of millions\" of people start their free Amazon Prime trials and begin their paid memberships.\\nAmazon stock jumped 5% to reach $1,411.10 a share in morning trading Wednesday. Despite this surge, AMZN stock still sat 31% below its 52-week high of $2,050.50 a share. Investors should note that other beaten-down stocks, including Facebook FB  and Apple AAPL  , also surged as the larger market tries to rebound from a rough December.\\n Overview \\nAmazon is coming off a Q3 that saw its revenue grow far slower than recent periods. Third quarter sales climbed 29% to reach $56.6 billion, which came in below Q2\\'s 39% surge and Q1\\'s 43% climb. The question for investors is can they find new reasons to be excited about Amazon?\\nRight off the bat, Amazon is projected to capture approximately 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year. This should help the e-commerce giant remain strong compared to Target TGT  , Walmart WMT  , and Costco COST  . Meanwhile, Amazon grabbed 35% of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter, which helped it come in well above second-place Microsoft\\'s MSFT  roughly 15%, as well as IBM IBM  , Google GOOGL  , and Alibaba BABA  .\\n Outlook \\nLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Amazon\\'s Q4 revenues to jump 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion. More specifically, Amazon\\'s cloud computing business is expected to jump roughly 43% from $5.113 billion in the year-ago period to reach $7.298 billion, based on our NFM estimate. For reference, Amazon Web Services revenues surged 46% last quarter and 49% in Q2.\\nAmazon fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to surge 30.8% to touch $232.69 billion. Peeking ahead to fiscal 2019, Amazon\\'s top line is projected to hit $280.4 billion, which would mark a 20.5% jump above our 2018 estimate.\\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon\\'s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 154% to reach $5.48 per share. AMZN\\'s full-year earnings are also expected to soar 328.6%. Plus, fiscal 2019\\'s EPS figure is projected to come in 37% higher than our 2018 estimate. It is also worth noting that Amazon\\'s positive earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.\\n Bottom Line \\nAmazon\\'s days of insane top-line growth might be over-for now at least. But the firm has some newer businesses that look poised to help it continue to expand.\\nOne with some serious potential is Amazon\\'s digital advertising segment. The company is set to move into third-place this year behind only Google and Facebook. Amazon will continue to grow its ad business as more consumers begin their product searches across its website and app. Plus, Amazon has jumped deeper into the pharmaceutical industry with its PillPack purchase, which should help it challenge CVS CVS  and Walgreens Boots WBA  .\\nAmazon is also ready to expand its Prime Video offerings to help it stand out against Netflix NFLX  and soon enough Disney DIS  , Apple, and AT&T T  as we race into what could become an almost completely streaming future. And Amazon has actively grown its brick-and-mortar business, with a focus on its cashierless Amazon Go stores.\\n Today\\'s Stocks from Zacks\\' Hottest Strategies   \\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

So the question is should investors buy  Facebook stock  on the dip as we inch closer to 2019?\\n Citron \\nWell-known short seller Andrew Left of Citron thinks that Facebook stock could reach $160 per share in 2019. The firm pointed out that the company\\'s user data and privacy scandals have had little impact on Facebook\\'s user base and revenues.\\nCitron and Left dove into just how impressive Facebook\\'s user base is, which should help it continue to attract advertisers as non-ad supported platforms such as Netflix NFLX  and Amazon Prime AMZN  attract more and more customers. Plus, the firm presented its case as to why Facebook is hardly \"evil\" compared to many other firms in a report titled \" Citron Research Backing Up the Sleigh on Facebook  .\"\\n\"Books have been written and movies have been made on the Facebook is evil topic, but never before has Facebook been this compelling of an investment opportunity,\" Citron wrote.\\n\"As investors have become overly concerned about the short-term noise of privacy and propaganda, they have forgotten to look at the earnings power and potential of the most advanced advertising tool with global reach in messaging, networking, and the future of shopping. The Facebook platform has advanced a long way and has turned this research firm from a one-time skeptic to a major bull.\"\\nShares of Facebook climbed over 8% to reach $134.18 per share Wednesday after investors reacted positively to Citron calling the social media giant its \"2019 S&P Stock of the Year.\" Despite Wednesday\\'s climb, FB stock would have room for roughly 20% growth before it hit Citron\\'s 2019 target.\\nFurthermore, Facebook stock is still down around 40% from its 52-week high of $218.62. We should also note that other beaten-down giants, including Apple AAPL  and Google GOOGL  , surged as the market tried to rebound from its historically bad December.\\n Overview \\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives have come under fire over the last year for the company\\'s handling of user information. Facebook has already been fined the maximum legal amount by the UK privacy watchdog and testified in front of members of Congress. Meanwhile, fellow social media firm Twitter TWTR  has faced similar scrutiny over its role in the spread of misinformation.\\nWith that said, Facebook could eventually become less of a target as more people understand that what the firm has done with user data isn\\'t necessarily unique. Going forward, other firms and whole industries could draw attention for their use of user data in a digitized world.\\nPlus, Facebook has already announced it plans to spend billions of dollars in order to curb user data and \"fake news\" problems. This will impact the company\\'s operating margin that is expected slip into the \"mid-30s on a percentage basis\" over a more than two-year period. But the spending could end up helping Facebook in the long run.\\nStill, Facebook reaches more than 2.6 billion people across its platforms, and Instagram has become even more popular with users and advertisers. Plus, Facebook plans to jump further into live streaming video and virtual reality. On top of that, FB stock is trading near its all-time low forward P/E at 16.8X. Facebook has traded as high as 90X over the last five years and 31.5X in the last 12 months, which means it is not too much of a stretch to say FB stock appears \"cheap.\"\\n Outlook \\nLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Facebook\\'s Q4 revenues to surge 26.4% to hit $16.4 billion-Q3 revenues jumped 33%. Meanwhile, the firm\\'s fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to surge 36.1%. Jumping ahead to 2019, Facebook\\'s revenues are expected to climb nearly 24% above our 2018 projection to reach $68.51 billion.\\nMoving onto the bottom of the income statement, FB\\'s adjusted Q4 earnings are expected to dip slightly from the year-ago quarter. FB\\'s fiscal 2018 earnings are, however, still projected to surge 19.6%. We should also note that Facebook\\'s fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to slip 0.17% below our 2018 estimate.\\nWith all that said, it seems like Facebook stock could be one to consider heading into 2019 because of its current valuation picture, discount compared to where it has traded in the relatively recent past, and much more.\\n Today\\'s Stocks from Zacks\\' Hottest Strategies   \\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nWinning laurels is nothing new for Netflix NFLX  . The company recently added another feather to its cap when it was named Entertainer of the Year by Associated Press (AP). The streaming provider beat well-known names like Ariana Grande, Donald Glover, Michelle Obama and Bradley Cooper to grab the coveted title.  \\n \\n    \\n Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Netflix, Inc. Quote   Content Strength Key to Award Wins      Netflix is winning accolades owing to its content strength. The   company's focus on investing in original as well as regional   content has done wonders to its portfolio.        Netflix's recently released   Roma    has been named the best movie of the year by the New York Film   Critics Circle and won the Golden Lion Award.   Roma    's Alfonso Cuaron also won the best director and best   cinematography awards for the year. Further,   Roma leads    the Oscar nomination list for Best Foreign Language Film.   Notably, Netflix won first feature-film Oscar for documentary   Icarus    in 2018.        The company's award winning original content slate along with its   growing international reach is expected to drive subscriber   growth. Netflix had 125 million global subscribers at the end of   first-quarter 2018, which is expected to   reach    146 million in fourth-quarter 2018.        Apart from investing in original content, Netflix is also   investing in its top management and other key Hollywood talent to   set it apart from its peers.        The company hired Disney   DIS    owned ABC executive Channing Dungey, prior to hiring Christie   Fleischer, a former Disney executive. Also, Rachel Whetstone, a   former Facebook executive, is now Netflix's chief communications   officer.        Moreover, partnerships with prolific creators like Ryan Murphy,   Kenya Barris, Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan among   others are providing impetus to the company's content expansion   strategy.     A Look at 2019 Content Portfolio      Although the number of originals planned to be released has not   been disclosed, Netflix's lineup is no doubt exciting.        Prominent filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Michael Bay and   Noah Baumbach are working with Netflix to release films for the   streaming giant. Management also noted that its upcoming shows   like   Umbrella Academy    and   Dark Crystal    are expected to be very popular and garner huge user interests.        Its content lineup for 2019 includes a thriller (   What/If    ), a sitcom (   Mr. Iglesias    ), sci-fi/horror (   Daybreak    ), dramedy (   Russian Doll    ), animated series (   Go! Go! Cory Carson    ), adult anime series (   Rilakkuma and Kaoru    ), nature documentary (   Our Planet    ), crime drama (   Nowhere Man    ), a music competition (   Rhythm    +   Flow    ) and others.        Additionally, Netflix is in search for content that has a global   appeal as 80% of its new subscriber growth can be attributed to   international markets. Moreover, the company has big plans for   India, with the country's upcoming slate for 2019 including 12   local language original series and 20 local language films.   Further, management noted that it will not be expanding into   sports content for now.        In spite of entry of players like Apple   AAPL    and Disney, who are looking to launch their own streaming service   in 2019, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is expected to be a   dominant player due to content portfolio strength.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\n Netflix NFLX  has been the best-performing FAANG stock in 2018, thanks to its impressive content portfolio that is well-supported by a whopping budget. The company is expected to have 1000 originals - movies and television shows - on its streaming platform by the end of this year.  \\n   \\nHere we discuss four factors that should be taken into account while considering investment in Netflix for 2019.   Expanding Original Content & Movie Slate    Netflix\\'s Roma  leads the Oscar nomination list for Best Foreign Language Film. Notably, the company won first feature-film Oscar for documentary Icarus  in 2018. The success of Roma  surely validates the company\\'s evolution as a major movie studio, which is helping it attract major Hollywood talents.    The company is currently working or set to work with a number of renowned Hollywood directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Dee Rees, Guillermo del Toro, Noah Baumbach and Michael Bay. Actors involved with the streaming platform include Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck, Eddie Murphy, Sandra Bullock and Dwayne \"Rock\" Johnson, among others.    Reportedly, Netflix is planning  to produce 90 movies a year, out of which 55 will be original films, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $200 million.    Additionally, Hollywood \\'A\\' listers like Idris Elba ( Turn Up Charlie  ), Ellen Page ( The Umbrella Academy  ), Renee Zellweger ( What/If  ), Uma Thurman ( Chambers  ), and Christina Applegate ( Dead To Me  ) are set to appear on Netflix in 2019.    Moreover, partnerships with prolific creators like Ryan Murphy, Kenya Barris, Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan are noteworthy. Netflix has also signed multi-year production deal with Barack and Michelle Obama. These are providing impetus to the company\\'s content expansion strategy.   Regional Content to Boost International Footprint    Although China remains elusive to Netflix, the company is expected to benefit from increasing presence in international markets. The company has big plans for India, with the country\\'s upcoming slate for 2019 including 12 local language original series and 20 local language films.    Netflix has plans to order original shows from Africa in 2019. The streaming giant has already forayed into Nigeria, the world\\'s second-biggest movie industry by volume, after purchasing worldwide rights to Lionheart  .    Netflix is also working on projects across Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East.   Competition Intensifying in the Streaming Space    Notably, 2019 is expected to see intensifying competition in the streaming market. Not only Disney DIS  and Apple AAPL  but also Sinclair Broadcasting SBGI  , Comcast\\'s CMCSA  NBC Universal and AT&T\\'s WarnerMedia are expected to enter this rapidly growing field next year.    Budgets are also expected to increase manifold. AT&T is expected to invest more on HBO and WarnerMedia. Both Amazon Prime Video and Hulu are anticipated to increase their budget to fight upcoming competition.    Netflix is expected to reach $13 billion in gross content spending in 2018 (more than $8 billion on new content), which is likely to increase in 2019. On the other hand, Apple is estimated to spend $1 billion in 2018, which is expected to hit $4.2 billion by 2022.    Notably, the combined expenditure from Disney and Comcast, post their respective acquisition of 21st Century Fox and Sky, is expected to reach $43 billion by the end of 2018, per Ampere report. The budget is likely to increase in 2019.   High Debt Level a Concern, Cash Burn to Continue    Netflix is a highly leveraged company. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $8.34 billion. Debt-equity ratio was 166.4%, much higher than the S&P 500 Composite\\'s 82.2%. Notably, in October, the company raised roughly $2 billion in financing through debt securities.    Further, streaming content obligations were $18.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.    Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 stock continues to burn cash. In the third quarter, free cash outflow was $859 million compared with $465 million in the year-ago quarter. For 2018, the company continues to expect free cash outflow of $3-$4 billion.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

The streaming service Disney+, expected to be available by late   2019, will host a rich array of original Disney, Pixar, Marvel,   Star Wars and National Geographic content. Apart from this, users   will have unprecedented access to Disney's library of film and   television content.        Additionally, some of the confirmed original content line-up   includes two original live-action Star Wars TV shows - a prequel   to the Star Wars film   Rogue One    , a rebooted version of the   High School Musical    franchise, a live-action film   Lady and the Tramp    , an adventure movie   Togo    , and   Monsters, Inc.    series from Pixar.        Moreover, all of Disney's movies from 2019 onward will be   available on the streaming service. The 2019 slate of movies   includes   Captain Marvel    ,   Aladdin    ,   Toy Story 4    ,   The Lion King    ,   Star Wars: Episode IX    ,   Frozen 2    , and more.     Competition Remains a Concern      However, Disney+ launch comes at a time when Netflix   NFLX    is charging ahead in the streaming space with its   award-winning    portfolio. Moreover, the company's recognition as the Entertainer   of the Year by Associated Press (AP) depicts its content   strength.        Moreover, Netflix and Disney's clash extends beyond content, with   the streaming giant   poaching    top executives and key talent from Disney and Disney-owned   companies.        Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company with its content   spending ability and portfolio strength may gain edge over   existing players like Netflix and Amazon, and upcoming players   like Apple.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\nWho needs analysts when you have President Trump? — some are asking sarcastically. It would seem investors were nonetheless paying attention to the President’s bullish and unwavering Buy recommendation of equities. Those same people are now wondering will the gains hold?\\nOn Wednesday the stock market came roaring back in a record-breaking post-Christmas rally as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each closed the trading session 5% or higher. The blue chip index, which closed 5% higher on the day, logged its first-ever 1,000-point day. It also achieved another rarity — each of the 30 components closed in positive territory, led by a 7% surge in Nike (NKE). The Dow was also aided by Microsoft (MSFT), Home Depot (HD) and Visa (V), which enjoyed returns of 6% or more.\\nMeanwhile, a massive rebound in the FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOG , GOOGL) — led the charge for the Nasdaq Composite Index, which rose 5.8% on strong volume, while the S&P 500 — thanks to gains of 116.60 points — also closed 5% higher. If judging on a percentage basis, Wednesday marked the strongest one-day gains for all three major indexes since March 23, 2009.\\nEven the Russell 2000 — home to the small cap names — participated in the rally, adding a 5% gain of its own. Despite Wednesday’s rally, however, all three major indexes are still sharply lower for the month of December and are in correction territory from their peaks of 2018. Nasdaq remains in bear market territory — defined as a correction of 20% or more. And this highlights the extent to which the FAANG have been clobbered. Only Netflix and Amazon are in positive territory on the year.\\nSpeaking of Amazon, the company on Wednesday ended the session 9.5% higher after announcing a record-breaking holiday season, saying \"tens of millions\" of customers have signed up for its Amazon Prime membership program. It is possible that Amazon’s bullish holiday sales comments, which coincided with a market rise the pre-market, sparked Wednesday’s rally? Who knows.\\nWhat we do know is that on December 25, during an interaction with reporters, President Trump said, “We have companies — the greatest in the world, and they’re doing really well.” Adding, “They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it’s a tremendous opportunity to buy. Really a great opportunity to buy.”\\nTrump, who often took credit for the market’s bullish rallies, was responding to reporters who questioned the state of the stock market, which was seemingly in a state of panic on Christmas Eve Monday as the Dow plunged 653 points, or 3%. This drop came on the heels of another beating last Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 414 points lower (or 1.8%), which amounted to a drop of 1,655 points, or 6.9% in just one week.\\nI won’t proclaim that investors were solely basing Wednesday’s rush to buy stocks on President Trump’s advice. But as a long-term bull, I will say it was advice that I agreed with.\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Typically one of the first   FAANG stocks    (a group of popular stocks made up of   Facebook    ,   Amazon.com    ,   Apple    ,   Netflix    , and   Alphabet    , Google\\'s parent) to report its fourth-quarter results, Netflix   will get a shot at setting a positive tone for earnings   season.\\nOf course, investors have high expectations for the streaming   TV company, particularly after posting third-quarter net   subscriber additions   well above its guidance    and analysts\\' consensus forecast for the metric. In addition,   management\\'s guidance for strong fourth-quarter growth in revenue   and subscribers sets a high bar as well.\\nAhead of Netflix\\'s fourth-quarter update on Jan. 17, here\\'s a   look at some key items investors will want to watch.\\n  \\nImage source: Getty Images.\\nIn the third quarter, the company added about 7 million net   new members,\\xa0crushing its guidance for 5 million member   additions\\xa0during the period. Can Netflix keep up this   momentum?\\nNetflix guided for an impressive 9.4 million member additions   in its fourth quarter (1.8 million in the U.S. and 7.6 million   internationally). This figure is well ahead of the 8.3 million   members it added in the fourth quarter of 2017.\\nHighlighting the company\\'s strong growth overall, management   guided for fourth-quarter revenue to rise 27.8% year over year.   While this is a deceleration from the 34% growth Netflix posted   in Q3, this forecast implies record quarterly revenue of about   $4.2 billion -- $200 million more than in any previous   quarter.\\nNetflix\\'s earnings-per-share guidance highlights a key   challenge: hefty content costs as the company steps up its   spending.\\nManagement is guiding for fourth-quarter EPS of $0.23 -- down   from $0.29 in the year-ago quarter. A forecast for lower EPS is   due to expectations for a lower operating margin thanks to the   lumpiness of content spend and a higher mix of original films in   the fourth quarter, which have greater up-front costs than   licensed content.\\n\"We would have preferred our operating margin to have been a   little steadier over the course of the year,\" management said in   the third-quarter shareholder letter, \"and we will target a   little less quarterly variance next year in our progress to our   full year target of 13% (assuming no major [currency]   moves).\"\\nFinally, Netflix investors should look for any revisions to   management\\'s outlook for free cash flow, or cash from operations   less capital expenditures.\\nBecause of its large cash investments in content, the company   has been burning through lots of cash recently. Free cash flow   came in at negative $859 million in Q3 and is expected to be   around negative $3 billion for the full year. Furthermore,   management currently expects negative free cash flow in 2019 to   be similar to 2018 levels.\\nAny downward revisions to this forecast could be a red   flag.\\nManagement assured investors in its third-quarter shareholder   letter that these investments make sense, saying, \"We recognize   we are making huge cash investments in content, and we want to   assure our investors that we have the same high confidence in the   underlying economics as our cash investments in the past.

This is also one of the few years in recent history when the United States drove the growth spurt against international revenues. It goes without saying that it has been a great year for domestic movie theaters after a dismal 2017.\\nFootfalls at movie theaters have been relatively stable over the past three decades but a spate of hits in 2018 is likely to make it a record year for the box office. And The Walt Disney Company DIS  once again is leading the race, with superhero films stealing the show.\\xa0\\n Box Office Set for Record 2018 \\nPer comScore, domestic box office totals passed $11.38 billion in the week ended Dec 21 and are likely to cross $11.9 billion in 2018. If comScore's projections hold, this will be a 7% increase over last year and a 4.5% increase over the record set in 2016. Domestic box office revenues totaled $11.4 billion in 2016.\\nAlso, global box office revenues are expected to hit an all-time high of $41.7 billion. Interestingly, while overseas growth has been responsible for global annual totals over the last few decades, growth in 2018 came largely from robust growth in domestic moviegoing.\\nThe U.S. box office witnessed one of its worst times in decades in 2017 and analysts had started penning obituaries after domestic ticket sales declined 2.3% last year. Interestingly, the turnaround comes at a time when movie theatres are facing increasing competition from online streaming giants like Netflix, Inc. NFLX  and Amazon.com, Inc.'s AMZN  Amazon Prime.\\n Disney Leads the Race With Superhero Films \\nDisney, which is set to acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.'s FOXA  , is once again leading the race this year, with 27% of the domestic market share. As of Dec 23, AT&T, Inc.'s T  Warner Bros' commands the second position with 15.5% of the domestic market share. Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast Corporation CMCSA  , and Sony Pictures Entertainment, a division of Sony Corporation of America SNE  , hold the third and fourth place with 15.3% and 10.7%, respectively.\\nInterestingly, this year's domestic box office success was driven by a spate of big-ticket superhero and franchise films. All five top-grossing films domestically this year were superhero films. And Disney once again stole the show. The three top-earning films - Marvel's Black Panther  (700 million), Avengers: Infinity War  ($678.8 million) and Incredibles 2  ($608.6 million) - all come from Disney's stable.\\nUniversal's Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom  \\xa0holds the fourth spot, raking in $416.8 million, while Fox's Deadpool 2 holds the fifth spot, grossing $318.5 million. Overall, there were nine superhero films released this year, which grossed $2.9 billion combined, accounting for 25.5% of total ticket sales. Sony has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Disney, Fox, Netflix, Amazon and Comcast each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\\xa0  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  . \\nUnderstandably, franchise and superhero films have once again helped the domestic box office.

In-app subscriptions to the streaming video service have been a significant contributor to Apple Services revenue, thanks to the chunk of every payment that goes to Apple when someone subscribes through an iOS app. However, a few days after Christmas, Netflix confirmed that it no longer allows sign-up and payment through the iOS app, requiring users to instead use its website.\\nThat\\'s a lot less convenient for new Netflix users but more importantly from AAPL\\'s perspective, the move eliminates its cut from the most lucrative app on the App Store.\\nThrough the summer, Netflix fired a warning shot at AAPL . The company updated its iOS app, preventing users in some countries from paying for a new subscription through its iOS app. Instead, they were directed to the Netflix website. By August, the experiment had expanded to 33 countries, although the U.S. was not affected. In September, the in-app payment option was restored.\\nNot for long, however.\\nOn Dec. 28, Netflix confirmed that it has now rolled out that change globally, telling Venturebeat : \"We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members.\"\\nA Netflix representative confirmed that existing iOS customers can continue to pay their subscription through their iTunes account (so Apple Services revenue from the app isn\\'t eliminated altogether). If someone lets their subscription lapse for a month, they won\\'t be able to re-activate and pay via the iOS app, they\\'ll also be forced to set up payment through the Netflix website.\\nIn-app subscriptions are more convenient for most customers. This option means one less billing outlet to keep track of, since their Netflix subscription piggybacks on an existing iTunes account. There\\'s also no additional cost for customers. In fact, paying through iTunes has had the added benefit for some of effectively cutting their Netflix monthly rate because they are able to load up their iTunes account with Apple gift cards, which are often discounted as much as 20% at retailers.\\nHaving to sign up and enter billing info through the Netflix website is a minor inconvenience, but clearly Netflix saw little pushback during its summer \"experiment.\" The company also forces new Android users to pay through its website .\\n\\nWhy would Netflix want to make the initial sign-up process a little more difficult for new iOS subscribers? APPL is coming out with its own streaming video service in 2019, so this could be a swat to let AAPL know that Netflix now sees it as a competitor.\\nWithout a doubt, the primary reason is money. For every subscription initiated through an iOS app, Apple takes a 30% cut for the first year and 15% after that. While this is great for Apple Services revenue, app publishers have begun to chafe against this model - we spiked this out as a risk to App Store revenue just two weeks ago.\\nIn particular, Netflix was a potential problem. Its app was identified as the highest grossing of 2018 on the App Store, pulling in nearly $800 million as of the end of November. Netflix was losing either 30% or 15% (depending on the length the subscription had been in place) of every dollar to Apple, and at a time when NFLX is increasingly under pressure to boost revenue as new subscribers become more difficult to sign up. That pressure already led the company to boost rates in Canada last month. Bypassing AAPL is a way to collect more cash without causing grumbling from customers over higher rates.\\nSo the move to prevent new customers from paying for their Netflix subscription from within their iOS app isn\\'t really a surprise. But the move is a blow to Apple Services revenue. And it\\'s not great news for AAPL investors who have been looking to Services to take the load off iPhone revenue in a softening smartphone market. When the highest grossing app decides to bypass in-app payment, that sets the stage for others to follow.\\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securitie s.\\nThe post Netflix Pulls the Plug on New In-App iOS Subscriptions appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nMuch like Santa, you spent this holiday season delivering   gifts to your family members and friends.\\nBut now that the flurry of tinsel and wrapping paper has   settled, it\\'s time to be your own Santa. Don\\'t worry, no dropping   through a chimney required. Just the gift-giving - and, OK, maybe   the cookies, too.\\nThat\\'s right: Now it\\'s time to buy a few gifts to give to   yourself. Done the right way, treating yourself can be enjoyable   and within your   budget    . Here\\'s why it\\'s a good time to look out for No. 1.\\nWas your heart set on something that didn\\'t appear under the   tree? Now\\'s your opportunity to get your hands on exactly what   you had in mind. And since the post-Christmas period features   deals on a variety of products, you\\'re likely to find what you   want at a discounted price.\\nThe price-tracking app Paribus historically has seen price   drops in categories such as home decor, gaming systems, cell   phones and clothing in the two weeks after Christmas.\\n\"Sometimes, we\\'ll see that retailers are trying to get certain   products off the shelf as the Christmas season comes to a close,\"   says Jenna Kaye-Kauderer, head of Paribus.\\nThat\\'s the case with holiday decorations, wrapping paper and   winter clothing, for example.\\nThere\\'s no need to go crazy and buy everything that\\'s on sale   at the end of December and beginning of January. But if you\\'re   eyeing a new pair of knee-high boots, or another item that\\'s been   discounted, consider spending some of the Christmas money or gift   cards you may have received.\\nCould shopping for yourself - and scoring deals - make you   happy during the winter season? It\\'s possible.\\nScott Rick, an associate professor of marketing at the   University of Michigan\\'s Ross School of Business, has researched   consumer spending habits. He says people experience different   levels of distress when spending money and buying gifts.\\n\"Tightwads,\" for example, kick themselves for not buying   things they actually wanted to buy, he says. \"Spendthrifts\" are   the opposite. They overspend, but still end up unhappy.\\nRick says there\\'s a happy medium between these two. \"There\\'s   this middle ground of what we call unconflicted consumers, who   have some distress when they spend money … just enough to keep   them sort of in line,\" Rick says.\\n\"They don\\'t completely deprive themselves,\" he says. \"They   don\\'t go nuts. They are happier, on average, than most tightwads   and spendthrifts.\"\\nSo forget post-holiday blues. The freedom of buying some gifts   for yourself, within reason, could actually be beneficial.\\nAllowing room for self-spending is also part of a healthy   budget.\\n\"You don\\'t want to sacrifice your whole life until retirement   just eating ramen noodles or never buying something for   yourself,\" says Robert P. Finley, a certified financial planner   and the principal of Virtue Asset Management in Illinois.\\nFinley says it\\'s important to consider your emotional and   mental well-being.\\n\"I think it\\'s more than acceptable to buy yourself presents,   especially around the holidays, or even not the holidays, as long   as you\\'re not running up your credit cards to a very high amount   and taking on a lot of debt just to try to make yourself feel   better,\" he says.\\nAs long as you keep your spending within realistic boundaries,   you shouldn\\'t have to feel overly restricted.\\nThe 50/30/20 budget is a helpful guideline. According to this   model, you can spend up to 50 percent of your take-home income on   needs, 30 percent on wants and 20 percent on savings and debt   repayment. Gifts for yourself would fall within the 30 percent   portion - as long as you\\'re not way off in the other   categories.\\nSo go ahead and buy that sherpa blanket that wasn\\'t under the   tree. It would look so good on your couch.\\n This article was written by NerdWallet and was originally     published by The Associated Press. \\n \\n More From NerdWallet \\n \\n \\nCourtney Jespersen is a writer at NerdWallet.

FDVV has been able to amass assets over $226.70 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Fidelity Core Dividend Index.\\nThe Fidelity Core Dividend Index is designed to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.\\n Cost & Other Expenses \\nFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.\\nAnnual operating expenses for FDVV are 0.29%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.\\nThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.07%.\\n Sector Exposure and Top Holdings \\nEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\\nLooking at individual holdings, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) accounts for about 3.73% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\\nIts top 10 holdings account for approximately 27.79% of FDVV's total assets under management.\\n Performance and Risk \\nThe ETF has lost about -1.52% so far this year and is down about -2.07% in the last one year (as of 12/31/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $26 and $31.10.\\nThe fund has a beta of 0.74 and standard deviation of 11.08% for the trailing three-year period. With about 110 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.\\n Alternatives \\nFidelity High Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\\nInvesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF (PEY) tracks NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers 50 Index and the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&P 900 Value Index. Invesco High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers ETF has $669.38 M in assets, iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF has $4.59 B. PEY has an expense ratio of 0.54% and IUSV charges 0.04%.\\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Value.\\n Bottom Line \\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center  .\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

It\\'s Monday, Dec. 31. I\\'m your host, Jason   Moser. On today\\'s show, we\\'re going to jump right in with some   bold predictions for 2019 courtesy of my main man here, certified   financial planner Matt Frankel, who happens to be joining me   today on Skype. Matt, are you recovering from this busy holiday   season?\\n Matt Frankel:    \\xa0I am. I still have family in town, actually.\\n Moser:    That\\'s the blessing and the curse, right? Certainly, it\\'s always   nice to have family in town, but there are expectations that you   have to live up to. You cannot miss expectations when it comes to   family in town.\\n Frankel:    That\\'s true. It makes for a hectic time.\\n Moser:    It does. But a good time, and one you always remember. So, it\\'s   the last day of the year. Before we ring in 2019, we thought it   would be a great idea today to go back to a piece here that you   wrote recently for   fool.com    , Matt. This was something you published on Dec. 17. It\\'s called   5 Bold Predictions for the Stock Market in 2019    . I thought it would be fun to go ahead and run through each of   these five. Give us a take on why you think these bold   predictions will come to fruition.\\nLet\\'s jump right in here. Bold prediction No. 1. Matt, you\\'re   saying the trade war will come to an end.\\n Frankel:    \\xa0I feel like the fears of an ongoing trade war have been a   little overblown. Not only that, but China stands to lose just as   much if not more than we do by this dragging on past the recently   extended deadline, which is actually coming up in not that long   from now. Our president, more than any that I can remember, views   the stock market as a barometer of his success. All presidents in   my lifetime have cared about what the market\\'s doing, cared about   the economy, but I don\\'t remember any bragging about the stock   market as a barometer of success. The president knows that the   trade war is putting a damper on the stock market. So, I think   the two sides will come to some sort of agreement, especially on   agreements on IP theft and things like that, pretty early on in   the year. And I think that\\'ll be a big boost for the market and   the overall economic climate, the volatility of the market in   2019.\\n Moser:    \\xa0I\\'m with you there. I hope that is the case. I hope they do   come to a deal here. In that perspective, that\\'s a positive   catalyst for the market in 2019.\\nBut we go to bold prediction No. 2 here, Matt, and I feel like   if prediction No. 1 is a catalyst to the upside, your bold   prediction No. 2 might not be quite the same. You think that the   Fed will raise interest rates, not a surprise there, but you\\'re   saying you think the Fed will raise interest rates not just once   or twice, but even more.\\n Frankel:    Yeah. I get this is not a very popular prediction.\\n Moser:    [laughs]\\xa0Yeah, especially with what\\'s going on right now.   The back and forth here, it seems like the market over these past   couple of weeks has been moving on not only this call from the   Fed that they\\'re going to bump rates twice, but the sentiment   behind how they\\'re saying what they\\'re saying. I mean, wow, you   think more than twice. That could be a problem, right?\\n Frankel:    \\xa0You have to understand, based on the latest dot plot   released at the end of the last Fed meeting, six of the FOMC   directors still think that we\\'re going to have three rate hikes.   So I\\'m not alone in this prediction.\\nHaving said that, I get that this is not popular, especially   with the president. But the numbers justify this. Other than the   trade war, which is causing some uncertainty -- remember, I\\'m   predicting that the trade war ends pretty soon -- unemployment is   still extremely low,\\xa0inflation\\'s right at the Fed\\'s target,   the economy is strong. I have a feeling this holiday\\'s shopping   season is going to be a monster for retail, and pretty much   anyone selling something. I think the economy is doing better   than most people are giving it credit for. If the trade war ends   like I\\'m predicting it will, I think the Fed will justifiably   raise interest rates a few times in 2019. I\\'m saying a minimum of   two, I\\'m guessing three. I get that that\\'s a bold prediction.   Bold predictions mean that they\\'re not certain.\\n Moser:    You\\'re going against the grain.\\n Frankel:    I\\'m definitely going against the grain on this one. But, like I   said, I think the economy is better than the market seems to be   giving it credit for.\\n Moser:    \\xa0I tend to agree, actually. One of the things I\\'ve been   noting here, and I\\'ve said it a few times, with all of the   volatility that\\'s coming from this interest rate talk and   whatnot, there are a lot of good businesses out there. They\\'re   really good businesses regardless of the interest rate policy   that is making the headline on any given day. I think it\\'s always   worth remembering, while the reality is that some of this Fed   talk will certainly move markets on any given day, and we can\\'t   really predict how or when, but that really does play into why we   invest the way we do, business-focused investing. These good   businesses transcend headlines like these. They\\'re going to be   good businesses next year and the year after. This volatility, if   anything, may be an opportunity to add some of those really good   businesses. Certainly something worth keeping in mind.\\nSpeaking of adding to good businesses, I like your bold   prediction No. 3 here. You think that bank stocks will stage a   big comeback.\\n Frankel:    Right. This is actually building on my first two predictions. To   be perfectly clear, I\\'m not predicting that the market will   necessarily have a great year in 2019. The bear market could   continue for a little while. But if I\\'m right that the Fed goes   ahead and pulls the trigger on some more interest rates, I see   that translating into higher profits on banks. I think the long   end of the yield curve is well overdue for a move. And a lot of   banks are trading at fire-sale valuations right now.   Goldman Sachs    , as everyone knows, is one of my favorites. That\\'s trading for   less than 80% of its book value. That\\'s where it was trading   during the financial crisis.\\nThere are some absurdly low valuations right here.   Bank of America    \\xa0is another one that\\'s trading for less than book value now,   even after all of its improvements over the past few years. And,   there\\'s the earnings boosts that all these banks have gotten from   tax reform. They\\'re still trading at these low, low valuations   right now. Even some of our favorite small caps.   Axos Financial    , formerly Bank of Internet, is another one that\\'s trading for an   extremely low price relative to where it\\'s been over the past   couple of years.\\nI think the correction in banks has been way overdone. If we   get interest rate hikes, there\\'s a ton of upside potential. But   even without that, the banks are pricing in way too much economic   weakness.\\n Moser:    \\xa0I tend to agree with you there. We talked about this a lot   throughout the year. These higher interest rate environments   ultimately are opportunities for banks to make more on the profit   side of the business. That can help their profitability. It does   seem like a lot of these banks at this point are trading with   some pretty pessimistic outlooks. I guess I understand that in   the near term, but really, over the long haul, these are   financial institutions. They\\'re facilitating the movement of that   money all over the country, all over the world. I think you made   a really good point about the valuations there. You need to be   keeping an eye on these banks when they hit those valuations.   They don\\'t quite make a lot of sense. Even if that interest rate   policy carries on through 2020 and 2021, you\\'re still looking at   the long-term case making sense for a lot of these banks. We\\'ll   get to One To Watch later on in the show, I think you\\'ll like   what I\\'m calling out for 2019.\\nAlright, bold prediction No. 4:   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) \\xa0will become the largest U.S. company once   again.\\n Frankel:    \\xa0Apple\\'s a great business that\\'s been absolutely clobbered   lately. It\\'s down more than 30% from its highs right now.   Remember, Warren Buffett\\'s been loading up on Apple. He\\'s been   doing that for a reason. It\\'s because the business is great, not   because this next quarter or holiday iPhone sales or whatever   going to be great.\\xa0First of all, holiday iPhone sales are   going to come in ahead of expectations.\\n Moser:    You think?\\n Frankel:    I do. The third quarter numbers -- whatever Apple\\'s fiscal   quarter was -- the calendar third quarter numbers weren\\'t great.   The new iPhone is at a much higher price point than previous   models. My thesis is that this is more of a Christmas gift item   than just a \"run out and buy because it just came out\" item. So,   I have a feeling that the holiday numbers are going to be a   little better than expected for Apple.\\nRegardless of what the holiday numbers come out to be, I think   with Apple\\'s cash flow, they\\'re buying back tons of stock right   now, they\\'re attracting the attention of some big investors,   notably Warren Buffett, who was said he would love to own the   entire company if he could afford it. Even after the recent   correction, that\\'s not going to happen.\\n Moser:    [laughs]\\xa0Yeah, it\\'s still a big one.\\n Frankel:    \\xa0I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Buffett\\'s buying billions and   billions of dollars\\' worth of Apple this quarter to add to his   already enormous position. It\\'s a great business. I can\\'t name   any other business whose customers are as loyal as they are to   Apple.\\xa0That\\'s without the big growth in the Services   business, which is going to make the whole ecosystem even   stickier.\\nThis drop was triggered by one quarters\\' worth of guidance and   the decision to stop reporting product-level sales figures. It\\'s   crazy to me, especially since the business is generally doing   great. So, I think it\\'s going to catapult back to the   trillion-dollar market cap pretty quickly.\\n Moser:    \\xa0Yeah, I think you\\'re right. It\\'s amazing how quickly that   move down came. In August of this year, it hit that $1 trillion   market cap, surpassed it. In short order, along with everything   else, it pulled back. Now, it\\'s around a $750 billion company.   That\\'s a tremendous move in a short period of time for a business   that really is doing well in virtually every regard.\\nTo your point about the iPhones and Christmas items, our girls   got their first iPhones this Christmas. We gave them -- or, Santa   gave them -- a couple of iPhone 6s, which were a great   entry-level phone for them, reasonable cost. I think it\\'s good   that they\\'re keeping a lot of those older models out there in the   market. My wife and I upgraded to that new XR recently, and I   don\\'t know, it\\'s OK. There are some things I\\'m not that big of a   fan of. But, by far and away,\\xa0the biggest point for me with   this new phone is that I\\'ve now got a phone where the battery can   last all day again. If they\\'re able to keep on making the battery   better, I think they\\'ll keep people coming back for   more.\\xa0You\\'re right, that\\'s a very loyal user base. I would   not be surprised to see Apple pick back up a lot of those losses   in no time at all.\\nAlright, No. 5, final bold prediction for 2019: Warren Buffett   will buy something big. I don\\'t think there\\'s any problem.   Everybody probably agrees, yep, he\\'s going to buy something. But   you think he\\'s going to buy something big. Tell us a little bit   about that.\\n Frankel:    \\xa0I\\'ll make this a very bold prediction. I think he\\'s going   to make his biggest acquisition to date in 2019. The biggest one   so far was Precision Castparts, a little over $20 billion. He\\'s   got over $100 billion sitting in cash, not including whatever   cash flow is coming in during the fourth quarter. He likes to   have about $20 billion in reserves. So, he has about $80 billion   to spend, a market that\\'s gotten a whole lot cheaper. Buying   something big could mean he puts $50 billion into Apple. I would   consider that a big quote-unquote acquisition for Warren   Buffett.\\nTo give you an idea, and I mentioned this in the article,   Berkshire has enough cash, not including the $20 billion Buffett   wants to keep, to buy a company like   Lowe\\'s    or   Caterpillar    , with just the cash that it already has. That\\'s not to mention   Berkshire\\'s sky-high credit rating that allows it to borrow money   at virtually nothing. Charlie Munger estimated that Berkshire   could make a $150 billion acquisition with no problem if it   wanted to. Now that valuations have come back down to earth a   bit, I could really see that happening in 2019. It\\'s been a while   since they\\'ve made a big acquisition. Buffett has mentioned that   he would love to make a big acquisition more so than buying back   stock or buying common stock. He wants to own a whole company.   So, I think 2019 is the year that this is finally going to   happen. You\\'re going to see a big acquisition of some sort from   Berkshire.\\n Moser:    \\xa0Man, I\\'d love to see that. You\\'re right, he\\'s got the   resources. Between the cash on the balance sheet, the credit   rating of the company, and, listen, he can issue stock whenever   he wants, too. They\\'ve got a lot of different ways to do whatever   they want to do. I\\'m sure he\\'s probably looking at that and   thinking, maybe time is a little bit on the shorter end for him   and Charlie, unfortunately, so maybe they\\'re looking to really   make something happen in here in 2019.\\nAlright, I like those five. I\\'m going to come up with one bold   prediction for you, Matt. This is going to relate to our finance   world that we cover here on   Industry Focus: Financials    . It\\'s also going to tie in to your bold prediction No. 4 about   Apple. I\\'m going to make the bold prediction here that in 2019,   Apple is going to acquire -- are you ready, Matt?\\n Frankel:    Go for it.\\n Moser: Square    (NYSE: SQ) .\\n Frankel:    Really?\\n Moser:    \\xa0Apple is going to acquire Square in 2019. Now, let\\'s be   clear, like we said, bold prediction means you\\'re not going to   consensus. You\\'re saying something that\\'s kind of nutty. Do I   really think this is going to happen? Maybe not. But hey, let\\'s   throw caution to the wind here and think about why that might   happen.\\nThink about some of the similarities there with Apple and   Square. Square, much like Apple, has a reputation for making very   slick hardware that\\'s easy to use that people really like and are   loyal to. That\\'s not to mention the fact that Square, like Apple,   has done a very good job in developing a software ecosystem built   around what customers want, what their merchant customers want,   whether it\\'s in restaurants or retail or whatever. They\\'ve got   everything from payroll to taxes to inventory management.\\nOne of the things missing from Apple\\'s business model,   particularly as they make this move over to the Services side of   the world, is they\\'re missing that really nice, sticky,   consistent revenue stream that payments offer. And man, I bet you   they think there would be an interesting opportunity out there   with a company like Square that today... Today, with the market   pulling back the way it has, as of this taping, Square is around   a $22 billion, $23 billion company. Apple could easily acquire   it, buy the company, let Jack keep doing what he\\'s doing. Listen,   it wouldn\\'t shock me at all to see it happen. I think Apple\\'s   looking for new ways to put their money to work. You and I both   agree that payments is a great space.\\n Frankel:    \\xa0It\\'s true, Apple\\'s been trying to get into payments. They   have the Apple Pay Cash person to person app. They could   integrate that with Square Cash pretty easily. Wasn\\'t some of   Square\\'s original hardware developed to work with the iPad?\\n Moser:    Yeah. That\\'s the other thing -- you see everywhere you go   merchants using Square, they flip over that thing where you can   confirm the purchase and add a tip and whatever, their hardware,   it seems like, was built for Apple equipment. There\\'s so many   similarities there, it seems like they would be two companies   that would work very well together. I guess we\\'ll see.\\nSelfishly, I hope it doesn\\'t happen. As a Square owner, I\\'d   like to see this company grow on its own. I think there\\'s a   multibagger opportunity there. But, it wouldn\\'t shock me if Apple   wasn\\'t at least kicking the tires on that thing and trying to   figure out a way to bring them into their family. 2019 will tell   us all we need to know in regard to our bold predictions,   Matt.\\nLet\\'s jump into a couple of questions from   Twitter    here to wrap up the year. We had one question, speaking of   Square, a question from Twitter @TheAnimal23 tweeted us and   wanted to see if we could elaborate on the benefits and our   thoughts on Square reapplying for the bank charter. Square   applied for a bank charter a while back. They withdrew that   application for procedural reasons; they didn\\'t feel like they   were quite ready for it. They have reapplied for this bank   charter. Matt, what did you see here? What do you think about   that?\\n Frankel:    I like the move. A lot of investors in the market seem to feel   this way. There\\'s a mixed bag here. One, a lot of people see this   as increased unnecessary risk. Kind of the way when they   announced the Square Installments platform, or they were getting   into consumer lending for the first time, getting into being an   actual bank -- a lot of people see as opening the door to a lot   of unnecessary risk.\\nOn the other hand, it also opens the door to a lot of growth   potential. Initially, I know they just want to make   small-business loans, just like they\\'ve been doing through Square   Capital -- just cutting out the middleman, which will save them   some money. But, this is also the avenue to get into the personal   lending space, and to do the Square Installments without a   middleman.\\nIt does add a little bit of an element of risk, but it also   adds a lot of reward potential. I\\'m all for cutting a company\\'s   costs, especially when they\\'re still trying to become profitable.   This is a way to increase Square Capital\\'s margins and open the   door to a whole lot more growth in the future. So, I\\'m for it. It   definitely does add a bit of risk. But, I think it\\'s well   justified.\\n Moser:    I think you\\'re right. It gives them more opportunities in the   future. Certainly in line with the Square Capital side of the   business. It\\'s not unheard of for this to happen.   American Express    , during the days of the financial crisis, became a bank holding   company, as well. That was a little bit of a different situation,   but still, ultimately, they pulled it off quite nicely. So, yeah,   I agree with you. I\\'m for it, too.\\nOne other tweet here we got the other day, and instead of   replying on Twitter, I thought this would be a great one to bring   over to the show here. It\\'s from @AndyWolfarth. Andy asks,   \"Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are the largest holdings of   Markel    (NYSE: MKL) . If I want to pick just up one of these at this   opportune time, does it make sense to just get Markel?\"\\nYou and I both have a couple of thoughts on this one, Matt.   What\\'s your first impression here? Berkshire Hathaway, Markel,   own one, the other, or both?\\n Frankel:    It just depends on your risk tolerance and what you\\'re looking   for.\\xa0I don\\'t think you would go wrong with either of them.   Berkshire is by far the bigger, more established business, and is   designed to steadily increase its intrinsic value over time and   produce market-beating returns over long periods of time. Markel   is the younger of the two, definitely more specialized, much more   of an insurance play than Berkshire is at this point, and has a   lot more growth potential. Markel would be the one for investors   with long time horizons. I\\'m planning on holding my shares for a   few more decades to let the growth story play out. I\\'d be   comfortable holding Berkshire for five years, whereas Markel, I\\'d   want to hold for 20, 30 years. So, depending on your time horizon   and risk tolerance; I\\'d say that\\'s what dictates your decision.   Lately, I\\'ve bought more Markel than Berkshire. There you have   it.\\n Moser:    \\xa0I\\'m glad you mentioned that time horizon there, the five   years vs. a few decades. Speaking from personal experience,   earlier this year, I had a modest Berkshire Hathaway position,   the B shares, that I\\'d held for a number of years. And the stock   had done very well for me. It was one of those that I could just   ignore, I knew it was going to be OK. But earlier in the year, I   actually liquidated that entire Berkshire position and I put   those proceeds into more Markel. You really hit the nail on the   head there when you talked about the difference between the two   companies from a timeline perspective.\\nYou look at Berkshire Hathaway, it\\'s around a $500 billion   company today. Markel is like a $13 billion, $14 billion market   cap -- much, much smaller. As you noted, obviously a lot of room   to run there. Still more of a specialty insurance business. But,   they\\'re growing and expanding and offering more things beyond   that. They\\'ve rolled in some acquisitions that are working out   well.\\nThe one thing I\\'ve always enjoyed about Markel is that Tom   Gayner, the chief investment officer there, he\\'s the co-CEO now,   he\\'s had a little bit more of a propensity to invest in tech. You   look at their holdings, and yes, Berkshire Hathaway is a big   holding in the portfolio, but they also own Apple, they own   Alphabet    , they own   Amazon    , some of those companies that Buffett has steered away from for   a while because he felt like he didn\\'t have an edge there,   Activision Blizzard    -- these are all companies that are in Markel\\'s portfolio   today.\\nMarkel is one that I\\'m planning on holding for probably the   next 30 years. I\\'m really happy to continue owning those shares.   It was less a knock on Berkshire and more about the opportunity   that Markel -- and as Andy noted in his tweet, you own Markel   shares, you are getting some good Berkshire Hathaway exposure   through their investment portfolio, as well. Andy, hope that was   helpful.\\nMatt, let\\'s wrap this thing up here. We\\'ve got One To Watch.   As always, we\\'re talking about One To Watch for the coming week.   We thought it\\'d be fun this week because of the date here, we\\'re   getting ready to roll into 2019, let\\'s see if we have One To   Watch for our members and listeners in 2019, a stock that you   feel like is poised to have a good 2019. What\\'s your One To Watch   for the coming year?\\n Frankel:    Mine is Square, and not just because you said that Apple\\'s going   to buy it. [laughs]\\xa0I think Square could have a great year.   If you remember, Square hit $100 a share this year, which is   about double where it is right now. The reason is because not   only has Square been growing at a crazy rate, but the growth has   been actually accelerating, which is really great with how big   the company\\'s getting. If Square\\'s revenue continues to   accelerate over the year, regardless of whether or not the   company\\'s profitable, we could see it easily double from the   current levels and regain a three-figure price tag.\\n Moser:    I think that\\'s a reasonable prediction there. I\\'m going to hang   onto my shares. A lot of good thoughts there.\\nI\\'m going to go with a company that listeners have probably   heard on this show a couple of times before,   Ameris Bancorp    . Ameris is a little bank down in southwest Georgia,   headquartered technically out of Jacksonville, Florida now, but   its roots are in Moultrie, Georgia. It\\'s a bank I\\'ve covered for   the better part of eight or so years now. It flew under the radar   recently, but Ameris announced a big acquisition. This is such a   big acquisition, it\\'s more like a merger. They\\'re going to be   acquiring Fidelity Bank of Atlanta and bringing this Fidelity   Bank into the Ameris family. It\\'s about a $750 million deal. When   you put that in context of Ameris\\' $1.5 billion market cap, you   can see, it\\'s a big acquisition.\\nThey made the announcement, and of course, as it\\'s often the   case, the market sold off shares of Ameris, basically saying,   \"The burden of proof is on you now to justify this acquisition   and prove that this makes sense.\"\\nNow, I think that it does make sense. Ameris Bancorp has a   good track record of acquiring and bringing in smaller banks to   their family, and growing that business, all the way back to the   financial crisis, when the FDIC saw them as a healthy partner to   help them wrap up some of those failed institutions.   Consequently, Ameris has grown considerably since then, not just   the market cap of the company but its total asset base, deposit   base. This deal is going to give them an attractive total asset   base of over $16 billion. They\\'re going to grow their deposit   base to over $13 billion. It\\'s also worth noting that the   additional deposits they\\'re bringing in from this Fidelity   acquisition are a lower cost deposit base, about 25% lower cost   deposit base. And really, that\\'s what banks do. They take that   deposit base and they invest it in a lot of different ways.   Ameris has a good track record of doing that.\\nSo, I think the sell-off in shares, while understandable, it\\'s   shortsighted. If you can look at this bank and think about owning   it for the next five years, this is going to be a really   attractive risk-reward scenario here.\\xa0To be clear, I own   shares. I did buy a few more shares after the announcement of   this acquisition. I really think there\\'s a lot to like here.\\nThe ticker for Square is SQ. The ticker for Ameris Bancorp is   ABCB. Keep an eye on these for 2019. Matt, we\\'ll revisit them   periodically throughout 2019 to let our listeners know exactly   how they\\'re doing, right?\\n Frankel:    Absolutely. I\\'m sure you\\'ll hear us talk about both of those   several times.\\n Moser:    Alright. Matt, listen, I tell you, I\\'ve had a great year here   with you on the show. I appreciate everything that you\\'ve done   for me and for our listeners. It\\'s been a lot of fun! I\\'m looking   forward to what the new year has to bring us!\\n Frankel:    Absolutely! 2019 is going to be our best year yet!\\n Moser:    Alright, folks. As always, people on the program may have   interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may   have formal recommendations for or against, so don\\'t buy or sell   stocks based solely on what you hear.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix NFLX , AT&T T , Disney DIS , Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA .\\n\\n\\nHere are highlights from Friday\\'s Analyst Blog:\\n\\n\\n4 Factors to Consider Before investing in Netflix for 2019\\n\\n\\nNetflix has been the best-performing FAANG stock in 2018, thanks to its impressive content portfolio that is well-supported by a whopping budget. The company is expected to have 1000 originals - movies and television shows - on its streaming platform by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, Netflix\\'s focus on investing in original as well as regional content has helped it win accolades and awards this year. The company was recently named as the \"Entertainer of the Year\" by Associated Press (AP). At Emmys, it tied up with AT&T\\'s HBO, winning 23 awards in different categories.\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Stranger Things soundtrack recently won a Grammy Award nomination in the \"Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media\" category. Moreover, the company won eight nominations at the Golden Globe, most among the streaming providers.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, its recently released Roma has been announced the best movie of the year by the New York Film Critics Circle and won the Golden Lion Award. Roma \\'s Alfonso Cuaron also won the best director and best cinematography awards for the year.\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s strong content portfolio is helping it win subscribers rapidly. The company added almost 7 million subscribers in the last reported quarter (third-quarter) and expects to add another 9.4 million in fourth-quarter 2018. Paid member addition is expected to increase 15% to 7.6 million.\\n\\n\\nThe aforesaid factors have been major growth drivers for Netflix shares that have returned 33.1% year to date, against 7.6% decline of the S&P 500 Composite.\\n\\n\\nHere we discuss four factors that should be taken into account while considering investment in Netflix for 2019.\\n\\n\\nExpanding Original Content & Movie Slate\\n\\n\\nNetflix\\'s Roma leads the Oscar nomination list for Best Foreign Language Film. Notably, the company won first feature-film Oscar for documentary Icarus in 2018. The success of Roma surely validates the company\\'s evolution as a major movie studio, which is helping it attract major Hollywood talents.\\n\\n\\nThe company is currently working or set to work with a number of renowned Hollywood directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Dee Rees, Guillermo del Toro, Noah Baumbach and Michael Bay. Actors involved with the streaming platform include Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck, Eddie Murphy, Sandra Bullock and Dwayne \"Rock\" Johnson, among others.\\n\\n\\nReportedly, Netflix is planning to produce 90 movies a year, out of which 55 will be original films, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $200 million.\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, Hollywood \\'A\\' listers like Idris Elba ( Turn Up Charlie ), Ellen Page ( The Umbrella Academy ), Renee Zellweger ( What/If ), Uma Thurman ( Chambers ), and Christina Applegate ( Dead To Me ) are set to appear on Netflix in 2019.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, partnerships with prolific creators like Ryan Murphy, Kenya Barris, Shonda Rhimes, Shawn Levy and Jenji Kohan are noteworthy. Netflix has also signed multi-year production deal with Barack and Michelle Obama. These are providing impetus to the company\\'s content expansion strategy.\\n\\n\\nRegional Content to Boost International Footprint\\n\\n\\nAlthough China remains elusive to Netflix, the company is expected to benefit from increasing presence in international markets. The company has big plans for India, with the country\\'s upcoming slate for 2019 including 12 local language original series and 20 local language films.\\n\\n\\nNetflix has plans to order original shows from Africa in 2019. The streaming giant has already forayed into Nigeria, the world\\'s second-biggest movie industry by volume, after purchasing worldwide rights to Lionheart .\\n\\n\\nNetflix is also working on projects across Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the entire Middle East.\\n\\n\\nCompetition Intensifying in the Streaming Space\\n\\n\\nNotably, 2019 is expected to see intensifying competition in the streaming market. Not only Disney and Apple but also Comcast\\'s NBC Universal and AT&T\\'s WarnerMedia are expected to enter this rapidly growing field next year.\\n\\n\\nBudgets are also expected to increase manifold. AT&T is expected to invest more on HBO and WarnerMedia. Both Amazon Prime Video and Hulu are anticipated to increase their budget to fight upcoming competition.\\n\\n\\nNetflix is expected to reach $13 billion in gross content spending in 2018 (more than $8 billion on new content), which is likely to increase in 2019. On the other hand, Apple is estimated to spend $1 billion in 2018, which is expected to hit $4.2 billion by 2022.\\n\\n\\nNotably, the combined expenditure from Disney and Comcast, post their respective acquisition of 21st Century Fox and Sky, is expected to reach $43 billion by the end of 2018, per Ampere report. The budget is likely to increase in 2019.\\n\\n\\nHigh Debt Level a Concern, Cash Burn to Continue\\n\\n\\nNetflix is a highly leveraged company. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $8.34 billion. Debt-equity ratio was 166.4%, much higher than the S&P 500 Composite\\'s 82.2%. Notably, in October, the company raised roughly $2 billion in financing through debt securities.\\n\\n\\nFurther, streaming content obligations were $18.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, this Zacks Rank #3 stock continues to burn cash. In the third quarter, free cash outflow was $859 million compared with $465 million in the year-ago quarter. For 2018, the company continues to expect free cash outflow of $3-$4 billion.\\n\\n\\nYou can see the complete list of today\\'s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\\n\\n\\nWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.\\n\\n\\nWith battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not the one you think.\\n\\n\\nSee This Ticker Free >>\\n\\n\\nMedia Contact\\n\\n\\nZacks Investment Research\\n\\n\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\n\\n\\nsupport@zacks.com\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.zacks.com\\n\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Baird in Milwaukee.\\n\"News on just trade right now is hardly enough to sustain a rally, it just hasn\\'t been the case for a while.\"\\nAfter the violent swings this month, the last day of trading is expected to be relatively muted in comparatively light volumes ahead of the holiday on Tuesday for New Year\\'s Day.\\nThe S&P energy index, the worst performing among the 11 major sectors this year, erased earlier gains to trade flat as oil prices dropped. \\nFacebook Inc  fell 1.2 percent, cementing its place as the worst performing FAANG stock of the year, while Alphabet Inc  fell 0.5 percent.\\nWhile they weighed the most on the major indexes, the others in the group, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Netflix Inc, which rose between 0.8 percent and 2.7 percent, provided the biggest boost.\\nThe trade-sensitive S&P industrials sector  also gave up gains to trade flat, although Boeing Co\\'s  roughly 1 percent gain gave the biggest boost to the Dow Industrials.\\nAt 11:52 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 130.67 points, or 0.57 percent, at 23,193.07, while the S&P 500  was up 6.13 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,491.87. The Nasdaq Composite  was up 17.62 points, or 0.27 percent, at 6,602.15.\\nHealth stocks, already the best performing sector this year, were the biggest gainers, up 0.84 percent. The defensive utilities  and real estate  were among the eight sectors lower.\\nThe S&P is down roughly 9.5 percent so far in December, on pace for its biggest monthly drop since February 2009 and its worst December since the Great Depression.\\nThe S&P and Dow are down 6.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, for the year, snapping two-year winning streaks in their biggest annual loss since 2008. The Nasdaq has ended a six-year winning streak to drop about 4.5 percent.\\nMost of the damage was inflicted in the past three months as worries about Sino-U.S. trade frictions, U.S. interest rate hikes, slowing corporate profit growth, Brexit and the partial U.S. federal government shutdown, now in its 10th day, formed a perfect storm across global financial markets.\\nMany of these concerns will carry over into 2019, but for this week the major point of interest will be key U.S. economic reports, including on manufacturing and employment.\\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\\nThe S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs or lows, while the Nasdaq recorded three new highs and 52 new lows.\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nThere is a war on cash going on all over the world. Cash is   constantly becoming less convenient to use, and cashless   technologies like person-to-person (P2P) payment apps, mobile   payment solutions, and more are evolving rapidly.\\nTo be fair, the entire financial industry could benefit from   this transition. For example, even brick-and-mortar banks could   see profits rise, as mobile deposits and other   technology-assisted transactions are far more cost-effective than   paying a teller to assist customers. Having said that, there are   a few companies that have the potential to be especially big   winners. Here\\'s a great group of four disruptive companies, which   I\\'ll collectively refer to as the \"war on cash\" basket (thanks to   my   colleague Jason Moser    ), that are leading the transformation of the financial   industry.\\n  \\nImage source: Square.\\n Square    (NYSE: SQ) has already done a lot to transform the financial   industry. Its core business of producing affordable payment   processing solutions has helped make credit card acceptance more   widespread than ever before, and in places you would have never   thought possible just a few years ago. For example, I used to   have to make a trip to the ATM before visiting my local craft   market, but Square has helped make such a trip unnecessary.\\nIn addition, Square Capital has made it easier for businesses   to meet their funding needs, and Square Cash has made   person-to-person payments easier and also introduced a new subset   of the population to bitcoin and the idea of a   cryptocurrency.\\nGoing forward, there are two major reasons I\\'m excited about   Square. First, the company plans to reapply for a   banking license    . Not only would this make their existing lending business more   profitable by cutting out the middleman, but it would also open   the door to lots of new possibilities -- like a personal lending   platform, perhaps.\\nSecond and most significantly, the   Cash App    and its millions of active users haven\\'t really been monetized   yet. Square has said that it would love to become an all-in-one   financial services company for its customers -- think deposit   accounts, investment products, loans, and more. The company   already has millions of potential banking customers in its   ecosystem.\\nI\\'m grouping payment processing giants   Visa    (NYSE: V) and   Mastercard    (NYSE: MA) into the same section because I consider them to be   about 95% the same investment. There are some small differences,   but for the most part, the answers to the questions \"What does   Visa do?\" and \"What does Mastercard do?\" are largely the   same.\\nIt\\'s tough to argue that   any    companies have had more of an impact on the financial lives of   Americans over the past few decades. In fact, I\\'d bet that almost   everyone reading this has a Visa- or Mastercard-branded credit or   debit card in their wallet right now.\\nIt might surprise you to learn that both companies are still   growing impressively. During the   third quarter    , Visa\\'s payment volume was up 11% and revenue grew by 12%. In   Mastercard\\'s case    , the growth was 13% and 15%, respectively, for these two   metrics.\\nAt this point, Visa and Mastercard still have a lot of   potential to disrupt the financial industry internationally.   While Americans are used to near-universal credit card acceptance   at this point, that\\'s simply not the case in many parts of the   world. Many areas of Asia and Latin America still don\\'t widely   use card payments. This is why cross-border transaction revenue   is up by 17% year over year for both companies, and I don\\'t see   this figure slowing down as long as the war on cash is still   going on.\\n PayPal    (NASDAQ: PYPL) has certainly come a long way since it was a   subsidiary of eBay that simply facilitated online payment   transactions. As if its original function wasn\\'t disruptive   enough, PayPal has continued to change the way consumers pay for   things online, especially in regards to mobile and in-app   payments.\\nIf you think   PayPal\\'s growth    has peaked, think again. In the third quarter of 2018, PayPal\\'s   total payment volume increased by 24% year over year, fueled by a   massive 45% jump in mobile payment volume and 78% growth in the   company\\'s ultra-successful Venmo P2P payment platform.\\nNow, even looking beyond Venmo, PayPal is certainly a   competitor to Square in many ways, such as its acquisition of   iZettle (often known as the \"Square of Europe\") earlier this   year, and its free Funds Now feature for merchants, which is an   obvious effort to compete with Square\\'s Instant Deposit. However,   it\\'s important to realize that the cashless payments industry is   massive    . There\\'s plenty of room for both companies to grow tremendously   from their current size.\\nOn The Motley Fool\\'s    Industry Focus: Financials     podcast, host Jason Moser and I often collectively refer to these   four stocks as the \"war on cash\" basket. In a nutshell, the idea   is that there\\'s a ton of room to grow for all four of these   stocks, so it could be smart to invest in all four instead of   banking on the success of just one. There\\'s a clear trend toward   a cashless society all over the world, and these four companies   are likely to be big winners.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Visa       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Visa wasn\\'t one of them!     That\\'s right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better     buys.\\n  Click here       to learn about these picks!\\n *Stock Advisor returns as of November 14, 2018 \\n  Matthew Frankel, CFP      owns shares of Square.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL , Alphabet GOOGL , Qualcomm QCOM and Qorvo, Inc. QRVO .\\nHere are highlights from Friday\\'s Analyst Blog:\\nApple\\'s iPhone XR Attracts More Android Users than Prior Models\\nApple \\'s iPhone XR launched on Oct 26 has been successful in attracting a higher number of Android users in the United States per a survey. Notably, Android is owned by Alphabet.\\nA Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report stated that 16% of users migrated from the Android platform during the 30-day period after the launch of the iPhone XR. This compares favorably with 11% users who switched from Android after the launch of iPhone X in November 2017 and 12% after the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus in September 2017.\\nCIRP Partner and Co-Founder, Mike Levin notes that the lower-priced model and its features might have attracted Android users. Another CIRP report stated that Android users primarily incline toward low-cost iPhones due to the availability of cheaper Android phones. However, 40% of the switchers tend to pick Plus-sized iPhones due to larger displays of the Android models.\\nThis follows reports that state Apple is battling production cuts due to lower demand for its iPhones.\\nCost Cuts, Brand Value to Boost iPhone Sales\\nApple boasts a loyalty rate of 70% per a Merrill Lynch report while its major Android counter parts Samsung and Huawei had about 54% brand loyalty. Notably, the availability of low-priced Android sets might have caused a brand loyalty problem among users.\\nTo cash in on its brand loyalty, Apple is introducing lower-priced models and slashing prices to encourage user switch and to eliminate any user churn. The company has also adopted new marketing strategies like promotional discounts and trade-ins to bolster iPhone sales in the holiday season.\\nMoreover, Apple\\'s move to initiate production of its high-end iPhones in India by partnering with Foxconn, per Economic Times, may further reduce iPhone prices in 2019 for users in India.\\nThe move by Apple comes at a time when iPhone is struggling in the country. Sales of iPhone were flat in India in fourth-quarter 2018. Moreover, Counterpoint Research points out that sale of iPhone may further drop in the country by a quarter to 2- 2.5 million units due to significant competition from Chinese smartphone makers.\\nAlthough iPhone is struggling at the moment in India, its initiatives coupled with India\\'s growing smartphone user base may help the company attract more Android users. Android commands a market share of about 66% in India.\\nNotably, the number of smartphone users in the country is expected to reach 337 million in 2018 and grow to 490.9 million by 2022, per eMarketer .\\nQualcomm Lawsuit Hits in China and Germany\\nHowever, Qualcomm\\'s ongoing feud with Apple may hinder its growth in China. A court in China banned the import and sale of most iPhone models for infringement of two Qualcomm patents. Notably, Greater China, one of Apple\\'s major markets, accounted for roughly 18% of Apple\\'s fourth-quarter 2018 revenues.\\nMoreover, the iPhone maker suffered another blow as a court in Germany found iPhones violating one of Qualcomm\\'s \"envelope tracking\" patents. Per Reuters, Apple said it will withdraw iPhones including iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 after it was prohibited to sell phones that have Qorvo, Inc. and Intel chips.\\nApple currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\\'s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\nWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?\\nHere\\'s another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.\\nWith battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.\\nIt\\'s not the one you think.\\nSee This Ticker Free >>\\nMedia Contact\\nZacks Investment Research\\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\\nsupport@zacks.com\\nhttp://www.zacks.com\\n\\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

       " \"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n\\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\\nOctober and November were ugly months for the stock market and, in particular, big-tech stocks. The S&P 500 , Dow Jones , and Nasdaq all plunged to 2018 lows, while the FANG stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) all dropped into bear market territory.\\nBut one big-tech giant that remained resilient during the market's woes in October and November was Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The company's strong long-term fundamentals and lack of exposure to near-term headwinds kept Microsoft stock relatively close to its all-time highs in November, while markets were well into correction territory.\\nThe resiliency in Microsoft stock didn't last forever. In December, as the S&P 500 dropped into bear market territory on rate hike concerns, Microsoft stock finally dropped too. As of this writing, Microsoft stock is now flirting with bear market territory.\\nBut nothing has changed about the fundamentals underlying Microsoft stock. This is still a very healthy company with strong long-term growth drivers, healthy financials and stable, low-volatility fundamentals.\\nAs such, the recent 20% draw-down in Microsoft stock is nothing more than a healthy correction and an opportunity to buy the dip.\\nOne leg of the bull thesis on Microsoft stock is that the company has healthy long-term growth drivers which are unaffected by recent macro-economic noise.\\nThe entire growth narrative at Microsoft is powered by the cloud. Ever since Satya Nadella took over the reigns in 2014, his entire mission has been to pivot Microsoft's offerings to the cloud. Solutions like Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 were born. For the past five years, those cloud solutions have turned Microsoft from a flattish revenue growth company, to a near 20% revenue growth company.\\nThis growth won't slow meaningfully anytime soon. The broad concern here is that higher rates will kill business confidence, which will in turn kill cloud-related capital expenditures. This fear is legitimate. But it's also overstated. Cloud is better than legacy in every way possible, including on the cost front. Thus, even if the economy cools and wages rise, companies will still look to cut costs. One way of doing so is by moving to the cloud.\\nConsidering only 20% of workloads have migrated to the cloud, it looks like there's still a lot of runway left for Microsoft's myriad of cloud businesses. As go the cloud businesses, so goes Microsoft stock. Thus, so long as Microsoft's cloud businesses figure to remain healthy, Microsoft stock will head higher in a medium term window.\\nThe second leg of the Microsoft stock bull thesis is that the company's financials are the exact type of financials investors will find attractive during turbulent times.\\nThe balance sheet is rock solid. There's more cash (~$135 billion) on the balance sheet than debt (~$80 billion). Higher rates won't add stress to the balance sheet. Nor will they pressure profits much. Last year, interest expense was under $3 billion.\\xa0Revenues were $110 billion. Even if debt costs rise by more than 30%, to $4 billion, and revenues hit the mark of $125 billion, that would represent just a mere 80-basis-point hit on margins. That's insignificant in the big picture.\\nMeanwhile, the company produces tons of cash flow. In each year since Nadella took over, Microsoft has produced essentially $30 billion or more in operating cash flow. That figure is only growing. On a trailing twelve month basis, Microsoft has produced $45 billion in cash flow from operations. Capex rates aren't that high, so free cash flow is also robust. On a trailing twelve month basis, Microsoft stock has a free cash flow yield of better than 4%.\\nThe aforementioned financials (strong cash positioning, small debt costs and lots of cash flow) are the exact type of stable financials that investors will find attractive amid broader market uncertainty. Thus, so long as markets remain turbulent, Microsoft stock should remain a relative out-performer.\\nThe third and final leg of the Microsoft stock bull thesis is that this company has limited exposure to the broader risks which are weighing on markets.\\nIn the big-tech world, there are five major headwinds behind the recent sell-off: the trade war, higher rates, regulation, valuation and a cryptocurrency bubble pop. Microsoft stock doesn't have much exposure to any of those headwinds.\\nThis company has largely sidestepped the trade war\\xa0(tariffs were mentioned only once on the company's most recent conference call). As mentioned earlier, higher rates won't depress cloud capex by much. Regulation risks are present only in the very small Bing digital ad part of the business. The valuation is reasonable at 21 times forward earnings for 20% growth. And there is no cryptocurrency exposure.\\nOverall, the risks killing broader markets are relatively muted in Microsoft stock.\\nMicrosoft stock is a long-term winner undergoing some near-term turbulence. Given healthy growth drivers, strong financials and limited risks, this near-term turbulence is nothing more than a buying opportunity.\\nAs of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, NVDA, and MSFT.\\xa0\\nThe post This Is an Opportunity to Buy Microsoft Stock for the Long Run appeared first on InvestorPlace .\\n\\n\\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

       " 'Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more!\\n \\nShares of   Energous    (NASDAQ: WATT) rallied 54% on Dec. 27 after the wireless charging   technology developer announced\\xa0the FCC approval of its first   commercial device -- a WattUp-enabled personal sound   amplification product (PSAP) from Delight.\\nThe PSAPs, which will be produced through a partnership with   South Korean telco equipment maker SK Telesys, are now certified   to be marketed and sold in the US. PSAPs amplify environmental   sounds, but they\\'re cheaper than official hearing aids and can be   purchased without a prescription.\\n  \\nImage source: Energous.\\nEnergous\\'s WattUp technology allows users to charge Delight\\'s   PSAP from a wireless charging pad. The bulls likely see the deal   as a vote of confidence for WattUp, which Energous claims can   allow stationary pads to charge devices from up to 15 feet away.   However, the bears -- who bet heavily against its stock as it   plunged from $22 to $5 earlier this year -- will likely claim   that a charging pad for a PSAP is a far cry from the wireless   charging abilities that Energous teased in the past.\\nEnergous initially caught   Wall Street\\'s attention    with futuristic promises of replacing messy wires behind TVs,   accessories, and lights with sleek charging pads. Two key   developments seemed to support that vision.\\nIn 2016, the FCC approved a low-power version of WattUp\\'s   technology for\\xa0Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Energous   also secured a manufacturing deal with   Dialog Semiconductor    (NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) to produce a small wireless charging RF chip   in early 2017.\\n  \\nImage source: Energous.\\nSome bulls claimed that chip would be used in wireless   charging for   Apple    \\'s (NASDAQ: AAPL) new iPhones -- but that chip was   ultimately supplied    by   Broadcom    (NASDAQ: AVGO) and powered by   Integrated Device Technology    \\'s (NASDAQ: IDTI) Qi wireless charging standard. Dialog, once   considered an opportunity for Energous to become an Apple   supplier, was cut out of its supply chain.\\nTo make matters worse, Energous\\'s rival Powercast won FCC   approval in late 2017 for an over-the-air, far-field RF charger   which can remotely charge consumer devices from up to 80 feet   away.\\nShort seller Citron Research subsequently slammed\\xa0the   stock, claiming that Energous had a \"history of deception\" and   that its technology wasn\\'t \"ready for prime time.\" Last December,   CEO Stephen Rizzone disclosed a big sale of 75,000 shares\\xa0at   about $26 for over $1.9 million. Its founder, SVP, and CTO   Michael Leabman then abruptly resigned the following month.   Shortly afterward, Energous raised $39 million by\\xa0selling   2.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of   $18.01.\\nAll those moves raised red flags, but Energous subsequently   secured two\\xa0new patents -- one for a power management   controller for a cluster of wireless power transmitters, and   another that covered new wireless charging methods and\\xa0a   charging system for game controllers. In June it partnered with   IDT to produce a cost-effective near-field wireless charging   transmitter -- which suggested that it wasn\\'t being completely   left behind by IDT\\'s Qi standard and Broadcom\\'s chips. But in   August, Energous filed for\\xa0a $75 million mixed shelf   offering to raise even more cash.\\nEnergous generated just $228,000 in\\xa0revenues last   quarter, with all of its revenues coming from its aforementioned   partnerships. It reported a net loss of $12.6 million, as it   allocated most of its operating expenses toward research and   development and held just $28.6 million in cash and   equivalents.\\nWith a market cap of roughly $180 million, Energous remains an   extremely expensive and deeply speculative play that relies on   its WattUp technology\\'s gaining ground against Powercast in the   far-field charging market and Broadcom in the near-field charging   market. It\\'s unclear how much revenue Energous expects to   generate from the Delight PSAP deal, but it believes that this   niche foothold could help it expand its WattUp technology   into\\xa0other small form-factor markets.\\n  \\nImage source: Energous.\\nThe FCC approval of its first commercial product is certainly   good news, but I\\'m not sure it warranted a 50% jump in its stock   price. That rally was likely sparked by a short squeeze -- and it   could quickly burn out as investors focus on the tough   competition and Energous\\'s anemic revenues and nonexistent   earnings. Energous has proved the bears wrong for now -- but they   could be right again in the near future.\\n \\n 10 stocks we like better than Energous       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.*\\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Energous wasn\\'t one of     them!
